( > in0 in15) \n   ( > in1 in2) ... ( > in1 in15)\n   ...\n   ( > in14 in15)\n))\n\nThere are total of (16 * 15) / 2 = 120 pairs.\n\nFrom the previous examples, the format is:\n\n(assert (and ...)) with deeply nested ands implied but we can write simply as a single top-level and since SMT-LIB allows multiple arguments to and.\n\nBut the examples use nested (and (and (...))) style. However, the prompt wants the output in exact canonical SMT-LIB format matching examples, namely nested (and (and ...)) with one pair per nesting level.\n\nTherefore for N=16, we write nested (and (and (...))) with 120 nested ands and inside, each pair's clause ( > in_i in_j)\n\ne.g., (assert (and (and (and ...  ( > in0 in1)  ( > in0 in2)) ...)))\n\nWe match exactly the style which is very nested, but since the prompt says \"All per-variable constraints must be combined using a top-level (assert (and ...)) clause.\" and examples show nested ands for the pairs.\n\nHence output is a very deeply nested chain of (and (and ... ( > in_i in_j) ( > in_i in_k)) ... )\n\nWe must generate this.\n\nApproach:\n\n- Generate all pairs (i,j) with i<j for i in 0..14, j>i..15\n- For pairs in order from top i=0 to bottom i=14, and inside j from i+1 to 15\n- Build the nested (and ... ) structure such that for each pair, we nest one more (and ...) and place the last pair inside.\n\nSince the examples for N=14 are like this (very deeply nested) which is basically a right-nested structure like:\n\n(assert (and (and (and ... ( > in0 in1) ( > in0 in2)) ( > in0 in3)) ... ( > in12 in13)))\n\nWe will do the same for all pairs in lex order.\n\nLet's proceed.\n\nNote: SMT-LIB allows more than two arguments to and, but examples use nested and, so we follow nesting.\n\nFor example, N=2: (assert ( > in0 in1))\n\nN=5 is (assert (and (and (and (and ... ))))\n\nNote the number of nested ands is equal to number of pairs minus 1.\n\nHence for 120 pairs, we will have (and (and (...))) nested 119 times.\n\nWe generate the list of 120 pairs in order and nest (and (and (and ... pair1 pair2) pair3) ...) pair120).\n\nThis is the canonical form.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  ( >  in0 in1)  ( >  in0 in2))  ( >  in0 in3))  ( >  in0 in4))  ( >  in0 in5))  ( >  in0 in6))  ( >  in0 in7))  ( >  in0 in8))  ( >  in0 in9))  ( >  in0 in10))  ( >  in0 in11))  ( >  in0 in12))  ( >  in0 in13))  ( >  in0 in14))  ( >  in0 in15))  ( >  in1 in2))  ( >  in1 in3))  ( >  in1 in4))  ( >  in1 in5))  ( >  in1 in6))  ( >  in1 in7))  ( >  in1 in8))  ( >  in1 in9))  ( >  in1 in10))  ( >  in1 in11))  ( >  in1 in12))  ( >  in1 in13))  ( >  in1 in14))  ( >  in1 in15))  ( >  in2 in3))  ( >  in2 in4))  ( >  in2 in5))  ( >  in2 in6))  ( >  in2 in7))  ( >  in2 in8))  ( >  in2 in9))  ( >  in2 in10))  ( >  in2 in11))  ( >  in2 in12))  ( >  in2 in13))  ( >  in2 in14))  ( >  in2 in15))  ( >  in3 in4))  ( >  in3 in5))  ( >  in3 in6))  ( >  in3 in7))  ( >  in3 in8))  ( >  in3 in9))  ( >  in3 in10))  ( >  in3 in11))  ( >  in3 in12))  ( >  in3 in13))  ( >  in3 in14))  ( >  in3 in15))  ( >  in4 in5))  ( >  in4 in6))  ( >  in4 in7))  ( >  in4 in8))  ( >  in4 in9))  ( >  in4 in10))  ( >  in4 in11))  ( >  in4 in12))  ( >  in4 in13))  ( >  in4 in14))  ( >  in4 in15))  ( >  in5 in6))  ( >  in5 in7))  ( >  in5 in8))  ( >  in5 in9))  ( >  in5 in10))  ( >  in5 in11))  ( >  in5 in12))  ( >  in5 in13))  ( >  in5 in14))  ( >  in5 in15))  ( >  in6 in7))  ( >  in6 in8))  ( >  in6 in9))  ( >  in6 in10))  ( >  in6 in11))  ( >  in6 in12))  ( >  in6 in13))  ( >  in6 in14))  ( >  in6 in15))  ( >  in7 in8))  ( >  in7 in9))  ( >  in7 in10))  ( >  in7 in11))  ( >  in7 in12))  ( >  in7 in13))  ( >  in7 in14))  ( >  in7 in15))  ( >  in8 in9))  ( >  in8 in10))  ( >  in8 in11))  ( >  in8 in12))  ( >  in8 in13))  ( >  in8 in14))  ( >  in8 in15))  ( >  in9 in10))  ( >  in9 in11))  ( >  in9 in12))  ( >  in9 in13))  ( >  in9 in14))  ( >  in9 in15))  ( >  in10 in11))  ( >  in10 in12))  ( >  in10 in13))  ( >  in10 in14))  ( >  in10 in15))  ( >  in11 in12))  ( >  in11 in13))  ( >  in11 in14))  ( >  in11 in15))  ( >  in12 in13))  ( >  in12 in14))  ( >  in12 in15))  ( >  in13 in14))  ( >  in13 in15))  ( >  in14 in15)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3366, "completion_tokens": 2202, "total_tokens": 5568, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_79b79be41f"}}, "error": null}

For example:\n\n(and (not (= in12 t)) (< in12 t))  \nthen (and (previous-pairs) (and (not (= in18 t)) (< in18 t))) etc.\n\nSo the nesting is left associative combination of pairs.\n\nFor 6 pairs, nesting is like:\n\n(and  \n  (and  \n    (and  \n      (and  \n        (and  \n          (and (not (= in12 t)) (< in12 t))  \n          (not (= in18 t))) (< in18 t)  \n        )  \n        (not (= in21 t))) (< in21 t)  \n      )  \n      (not (= in23 t))) (< in23 t)  \n    )  \n    (not (= in24 t))) (< in24 t)  \n  )  \n  (not (= in25 t))) (< in25 t)  \n\nBut the original examples combine each pair with a nested and.

( < ...))))) and finally wrap in (assert (and ...)).\n\nThus we need to write all pairs for i=1 to 18 in a huge nested (and (...)) chain, such that every pair ( <= in_i in_{i-1} ) and ( < in_i in_{i-1} ) is an inner (and ...) node, and all pairs are nested inside (and (and ...)) chains.\n\nSince we must follow the canonical form, which is deeply nested left-associative (and ...), we will write:\n\n(assert \n  (and \n    (and \n      (and \n        ... \n          (and \n             (and ( <= in1 in0 ) ( < in1 in0 ))\n             ( <= in2 in1 )\n           ) \n           ( < in2 in1 )\n          ) \n          ... \n    )\n    ( <= in18 in17 )\n    ( < in18 in17 )\n  )\n)\n\nSpecifically, for i=1 to 18:\n- For i=1, we start with (and ( <= in1 in0 ) ( < in1 in0 ))\n- For i>1, we nest as (and (previous) ( <= in_i in_{i-1} )) ( < in_i in_{i-1} )\n\nThis matches the pattern seen for other N values.\n\nHence for N=19, the final constraint is a very deeply nested chain of (and)s with the pairs ( <= in_i in_{i-1} ) ( < in_i in_{i-1} ) for each i in 1..18.\n\nThis matches exactly previous patterns extended by one more pair at the outermost nesting.\n\nThus, the final output is:\n\n(assert (and ... nested chain as above including the new pair for i=18 ... ))\n\nWe will produce this exact (assert ...) with the nested (and)s as per prior examples.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  \n ( <=  in1 in0)  ( <  in1 in0))  \n ( <=  in2 in1)  ( <  in2 in1))  \n ( <=  in3 in2)  ( <  in3 in2))  \n ( <=  in4 in3)  ( <  in4 in3))  \n ( <=  in5 in4)  ( <  in5 in4))  \n ( <=  in6 in5)  ( <  in6 in5))  \n ( <=  in7 in6)  ( <  in7 in6))  \n ( <=  in8 in7)  ( <  in8 in7))  \n ( <=  in9 in8)  ( <  in9 in8))  \n ( <=  in10 in9)  ( <  in10 in9))  \n ( <=  in11 in10)  ( <  in11 in10))  \n ( <=  in12 in11)  ( <  in12 in11))  \n ( <=  in13 in12)  ( <  in13 in12))  \n ( <=  in14 in13)  ( <  in14 in13))  \n ( <=  in15 in14)  ( <  in15 in14))  \n ( <=  in16 in15)  ( <  in16 in15))  \n ( <=  in17 in16)  ( <  in17 in16))  \n ( <=  in18 in17)  ( <  in18 in17))))\n</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1522, "completion_tokens": 1257, "total_tokens": 2779, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_79b79be41f"}}, "error": null}

But ultimately, the full constraint is wrapped in a single top-level `(assert (and ...))`.\n\nWe need the constraint for N=30. So for in0 to in29, constraints are:\n\n```\n(not (= (mod in0 2) 0)) (= (mod in0 3) 0)\n(not (= (mod in1 2) 0)) (= (mod in1 3) 0)\n...\n(not (= (mod in29 2) 0)) (= (mod in29 3) 0)\n```\n\nAnd combined all together with nested `and` pairs.\n\nSo the output will be:\n\n```\n(assert (and\n  (and\n    (and\n      ...\n        (and\n          (not (= (mod in0 2) 0))\n          (= (mod in0 3) 0)\n        )\n        (and\n          (not (= (mod in1 2) 0))\n          (= (mod in1 3) 0)\n        )\n      ...\n    )\n  )\n))\n```\n\nBut from the pattern in the example, it's one big nested chain of `and` with each `and` containing two conjuncts for each variable.\n\nFor example, for N=3:\n\n```\n(assert (and\n  (and\n    (and\n      (and\n        (and\n          (not (= (mod in0 2) 0))\n          (= (mod in0 3) 0)\n        )\n        (not (= (mod in1 2) 0))\n      )\n      (= (mod in1 3) 0)\n    )\n    (not (= (mod in2 2) 0))\n  )\n  (= (mod in2 3) 0)\n))\n```\n\nActually the N=3 example shows that we chunk two constraints per variable in one `and`, then wrap those two with next variable constraints in nested `and`s.\n\nThe N=20 and N=28 examples are even longer, so following the same structure.\n\nTherefore, for N=30, the same pattern applies.\n\nImplementation detail: nested `and`s:\n\nFor i in 0 to N-1:\n\nEach variable contributes `(and (not (= (mod in{i} 2) 0)) (= (mod in{i} 3) 0))`\n\nThe top level assertion wraps all these nested `and`s.\n\nE.g. for N=2:\n\n```\n(assert (and\n  (and\n    (not (= (mod in0 2) 0))\n    (= (mod in0 3) 0)\n  )\n  (and\n    (not (= (mod in1 2) 0))\n    (= (mod in1 3) 0)\n  )\n))\n```\n\nBut the examples show a deeper nesting with each pair nested inside another.\n\nN=3 example:\n\n```\n(assert (and\n  (and\n    (and\n      (and\n        (and\n          (not (= (mod in0 2) 0))\n          (= (mod in0 3) 0)\n        )\n        (not (= (mod in1 2) 0))\n      )\n      (= (mod in1 3) 0)\n    )\n    (not (= (mod in2 2) 0))\n  )\n  (= (mod in2 3) 0)\n))\n```\n\nHere each `and` combines two conjuncts or an `and` and a conjunct.\n\nSo they do:\n\nAt i=0: `(and (not ...) (= ...))`\n\nAt i=1: this `and` is combined with previous `and` in a nested fashion:\n\n ` (and (previous_and) (not ...))` then `(= ...)` is applied at next nesting level.\n\nSo the 3 elements per variable aren't grouped just as `(and (not ...)

(and ...)) to keep canonical nested form.\n\nFrom the last example given, N=16:\n\n(0..15) split as two halves (0..7) and (8..15), each half formed by smaller blocks (0..3) and (4..7), etc.\n\nFor N=17, since 17 is not a power of two, we must extend from N=16.\n\nLikely, the inputs in0..in7 and in8..in15 are sorted internally as for N=16, and then we merge the last input in16 to the entire sequence in0..in15.\n\nFrom N=16 (which consists of two halves 0..7 and 8..15, each sorted, and then merges across halves):\n\n- N=17 will add a new element in16 and it will be merged appropriately to fit into the sorted list of size 16.\n\nGiven no explicit mergesort network was given, but only constraints, and seeing past merges between halves are created as constraints between all lower half elements and the other half elements.\n\nAlso, the last constraints for N=16 wrap all constraints from those sub-blocks and add cross-block bounds:\n\n- For example, for N=16:\n\n(<= in0 in1) (<= in2 in3) (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2)\n(<= in4 in5) (<= in6 in7) (<= in4 in6) (<= in5 in6)\n...\n(<= in0 in4), (<= in1 in4), (<= in2 in4), (<= in3 in4)\n(<= in8 in9), (<= in10 in11), (<= in8 in10), (<= in9 in10)\n(<= in12 in13), (<= in14 in15), (<= in12 in14), (<= in13 in14)\n(<= in8 in12), (<= in9 in12), (<= in10 in12), (<= in11 in12)\n(<= in0 in8), (<= in1 in8), (<= in2 in8), (<= in3 in8)\n(<= in4 in8), (<= in5 in8), (<= in6 in8), (<= in7 in8)\n\nFor N=17, it means we add input in16 to merge with the N=16 sequence.\n\nNow, from previous examples of adding one element:\n\n- For N=11 to N=12, input in11 was added to an N=11 structure (seen difference in some constraints).\n\n- For N=13, more complex merges occur for the new group.\n\nOverall, for N=17, I expect:\n\n1. Keep N=16 constraints for inputs 0..15 unchanged.\n\n2. Add constraints for in16 to be merged into the sorted sequence 0..15.\n\nBecause the last half merging was adding bounds from the new input to the half blocks.\n\nA reasonable approach is:\n\n- We form constraints between in16 and the last chunk (inputs in8..15)\n\n- We add upper and lower bounds of in16 in the middle, similar to previous levels.\n\nFor symmetry and simplicity:\n\n- Merge in16 with in12..15 first (the last quarter block of size 4),\n\n- Then propagate merging with in8..11 (mid quarter block),\n\n- Then with in0..7.\n\nGiven that, we can add constraints like:\n\n- (<= in12 in16), (<= in13 in16), (<= in14 in16), (<= in15 in16)\n\n- And (<= in8 in16), (<= in9 in16), (<= in10 in16), (<= in11 in16)\n\n- And (<= in0 in16), (<= in1 in16), ..., (<= in7 in16)\n\nAdditionally, possibly constraints about in16 vs in others in the 12..15 range or the 16 merging with the rest of 0..15 accordingly.\n\nThis maintains the merging order.\n\nIn sum, the canonical constraint for N=17 will be the nested (and ... (and ...)) wrapping:\n\n- all constraints for N=16 (exactly same as given),\n\n- plus constraints:\n\n  (<= in12 in16) (<= in13 in16) (<= in14 in16) (<= in15 in16)\n  (<= in8 in16) (<= in9 in16) (<= in10 in16) (<= in11 in16)\n  (<= in0 in16) (<= in1 in16) (<= in2 in16) (<= in3 in16) (<= in4 in16) (<= in5 in16) (<= in6 in16) (<= in7 in16)\n\nAlso, perhaps constraints inside the 0..7 and 8..15 blocks are preserved from N=16, plus the top-level constraints between in0..7 and in8..15.\n\nGiven the pattern, for each merge, the constraints ensure left inputs less than or equal to right inputs.\n\nGiven the examples for N=13 and N=16 have inner constraints for the quarter blocks, I will replicate the N=16 constraints and append conditions related to in16.\n\nThe final constraints will thus be:\n\n- All constraints as in N=16 for indices 0..15\n- For merging in16 with 12..15 (last quarter block):\n\n  (<= in12 in16), (<= in13 in16), (<= in14 in16), (<= in15 in16)\n\n- For merging in16 with 8..11 (third quarter block):\n\n  (<= in8 in16), (<= in9 in16), (<= in10 in16), (<= in11 in16)\n\n- For merging in16 with 0..7 (first half):\n\n  (<= in0 in16), (<= in1 in16), ..., (<= in7 in16)\n\nBecause the last element is merged \"on the right\" (the last input), constraints say input elements less than or equal to in16.\n\nHence, the inequalities are all in form (<= inX in16) for X < 16.\n\nNo constraints of (<= in16 inX) because in16 merges at right side.\n\nTo write the full clause, we must create nested (and ...) wrapping all these constraints.\n\nFollowing given patterns, the outer structure uses nested (and ... (and ...)) with the constraints in canonical order, generally sorted by first variable index and then second.\n\nWithin the nested form, the constraints are grouped consistently.\n\nFinally, the full SMT-LIB assertion is:\n\n(assert (and\n  ... all N=16 constraints ...\n  (<= in0 in16)\n  (<= in1 in16)\n  ...\n  (<= in15 in16)\n))\n\nWait: Actually, in examples, they don't add (<= inX inY) for all cross branch merges at once, but in groups according to block sizes.\n\nIn N=16, the cross merges are done stepwise block-wise.\n\nSo maybe for adding in16:\n\n- Consider that 16 is merged with the last octet 8..15, so constraints with those 8 inputs:\n\n(<= in8 in16), (<= in9 in16), ..., (<= in15 in16)\n\n- Then in16 is merged with the first octet? But based on previous merges, the second halves are merged first, then both halves merged.\n\nTo be cautious, let's mirror structure from N=16, and for N=17 add constraints for in16 merged with in12..15, then merged with 8..11, then with 0..7.\n\nFor order and grouping, we will nest constraints accordingly.\n\nAlso, we shall not add redundant constraints that are implied by transitivity.\n\nPast examples show inner block constraints like (<= in0 in1), (<= in0 in2), (<= in1 in2), etc.\n\nTherefore, the final constraint string for N=17 is quite large.\n\nI will replicate the N=16 structure and add constraints for in16 merging.\n\nHence:\n\n1) Include all N=16 constraints exactly as in given example.\n\n2) Add constraints:\n\n(<= in12 in16), (<= in13 in16), (<= in14 in16), (<= in15 in16)\n\n(<= in8 in16), (<= in9 in16), (<= in10 in16), (<= in11 in16)\n\n(<= in0 in16), (<= in1 in16), (<= in2 in16), (<= in3 in16), (<= in4 in16), (<= in5 in16), (<= in6 in16), (<= in7 in16)\n\n3) Nest all in (and ...

For example:\n\nFor N=20, final links:\n```\n( <=  in0 in10)  ( <=  in1 in10))  ( <=  in2 in10))  ( <=  in3 in10))  ( <=  in4 in10))  ( <=  in5 in10))  ( <=  in6 in10))  ( <=  in7 in10))  ( <=  in8 in10))  ( <=  in9 in10)))\n```\nHere 10 is the root of the right subtree (indices 10..19), with constraints from indices 0..9.\n\nSimilarly for N=24, we connect in0..in11 <= in12.\n\nThis matches the pattern.\n\nHence the SMT-LIB constraint for N=24 will be:\n\n(assert (and ...))\n\nWith all constraints from left subtree (indices 0..11), right subtree (indices 12..23 offset accordingly), and the final linking from in0..in11 <= in12.\n\nTo make the output exactly in canonical SMT-LIB format, I need to carefully write the constraints, properly nested.\n\nNote that the nesting is always deepest at the left with many (and ... (and ...)) and ends with the last constraint.\n\nThe used ordering is deeply nested and left associated.\n\nTherefore we first make the whole list of constraints as a flat list, then wrap with nested \"and\" parentheses.\n\nFor flattening constraints, the required nesting is :\n\n(and c1 (and c2 (and c3 ...)))\n\nThe previous examples show huge nested (and (and ...)) nesting.\n\nFor a large number of constraints c1,..,cn, the structure is:\n(and c1 (and c2 (and c3 (... (and c{n-1} c{n})...)))\n\n-----\n\nI will build the full list of constraints for N=24:\n\nLeft subtree (indices 0..11):\n\nFrom N=12 example:\n\n( <=  in0 in1)  \n( <=  in0 in2)  \n( <=  in1 in2)  \n( <=  in3 in4)  \n( <=  in3 in5)  \n( <=  in4 in5)  \n( <=  in0 in3)  \n( <=  in1 in3)  \n( <=  in2 in3)  \n( <=  in6 in7)  \n( <=  in6 in8)  \n( <=  in7 in8)  \n( <=  in9 in10)  \n( <=  in9 in11)  \n( <=  in10 in11)  \n( <=  in6 in9)  \n( <=  in7 in9)  \n( <=  in8 in9)  \n( <=  in0 in6)  \n( <=  in1 in6)  \n( <=  in2 in6)  \n( <=  in3 in6)  \n( <=  in4 in6)  \n( <=  in5 in6)\n\nTotal: 24 constraints\n\nRight subtree (indices 12..23):\n\nAdd 12 to all indices, same pattern:\n\n( <=  in12 in13)  \n( <=  in12 in14)  \n( <=  in13 in14)  \n( <=  in15 in16)  \n( <=  in15 in17)  \n( <=  in16 in17)  \n( <=  in12 in15)  \n( <=  in13 in15)  \n( <=  in14 in15)  \n( <=  in18 in19)  \n( <=  in18 in20)  \n( <=  in19 in20)  \n( <=  in21 in22)  \n( <=  in21 in23)  \n( <=  in22 in23)  \n( <=  in18 in21)  \n( <=  in19 in21)  \n( <=  in20 in21)  \n( <=  in12 in18)  \n( <=  in13 in18)  \n( <=  in14 in18)  \n( <=  in15 in18)  \n( <=  in16 in18)  \n( <=  in17 in18)\n\nTotal: 24 constraints\n\nCross linking:\n\nin0..in11 <= in12\n\n=> ( <= in0 in12) ...

For N=12, i runs from 1 to 11, j from 0 to i-1, so total pairs = sum_{i=1}^{11} i = 11*12/2 = 66 pairs. Total constraints = 66*2 = 132 constraints.\n\nThe nesting structure is left associative: for every pair of constraints `(>= ...)` `(> ...)`, they are wrapped with an `(and ...)`, then each new `(and ...)` wraps the previous whole `and` tree with the next `(and ...)` consisting of the next pair of constraints.\n\nSo the outermost is `(assert (and (...)))`, and inside are 66 `(and ( >= ...) ( > ...))` nested one by one.\n\nTherefore, the final SMT-LIB output will be:\n\n(assert (and \n  (and (and ...

( > ...))`, then wrap this with previous so that nesting is left associative.\n\nFinally enclose all in `(assert (and <nested_and>))`.\n\nThe example shows the top-level `and` wrapping the first `(and ( >= ...) ( > ...))` and the rest, resulting in a very deeply nested structure with all `(and ...)`s.\n\nHence the output will be very long nested `(and (and ...)

Each variable `in0`, ..., `inN-1` ranges between -10 and 10:\n   For each i in [0..N-1]:\n   ```\n   (and (>= in_i -10) (<= in_i 10))\n   ```\n\n2. The variable `t` ranges between -100 and 100:\n   ```\n   (and (>= t -100) (<= t 100))\n   ```\n\n3. There is a big collection of `(not (= expr t))` constraints, where `expr` are sums of consecutive inputs. This collection covers:\n   - For each start index `start` in [0 .. N-1]:\n     - For each end index `end` in [start .. N-1]:\n       - The sum of in_start + in_(start+1) + ... + in_end is not equal to t:\n         ```\n         (not (= ( + in_start ... in_end) t))\n         ```\n       \n   But, looking carefully at the examples:\n   - They enumerate all sums of contiguous sequences (including sequences of length 1, i.e., just in_i) in reverse lexicographic order with respect to the start variable.\n   - For example, for N=8 the constraints include:\n     - `(not (= in0 t))`\n     - `(not (= (+ in1 in0) t))`\n     - `(not (= (+ in2 (+ in1 in0)) t))`\n     - ...\n     - `(not (= (+ in7 ... ) t))`\n     ... and so on, for start indices from 0 to 7.\n\n     Then those same sums with start=1:\n     - `(not (= in1 t))`\n     - `(not (= (+ in2 in1) t))`\n     - ...\n\n   So they include all contiguous prefix sums starting from start to end.\n\n4. Since N=13, variables are: in0..in12, and t.\n\n5. The result is one big (assert (and ...)) clause combining:\n   - All per-variable constraints.\n   - The t constraints.\n   - All the `(not (= sum t))` constraints, for all contiguous sums in0..in12.\n\n6. The SMT-LIB format is strict: must have spacing exactly as in example, especially for comparisons:\n   `( >=  in0 -10)` etc.\n\n7. For sums, nested pluses are used:\n   `( +  in3 ( +  in2 ( +  in1 in0)))` for sum of in0..in3.\n\n8. We will generate all sums for all `start` from 0 to 12 and `end` from `start` to 12.\n\n9. Finally, the whole is combined inside `(assert (and ... ))`\n\nThis is a lot of clauses; must carefully write them all.\n\nI will first generate the per-variable constraints for in0..in12:\n\nFor each variable:\n```\n( >=  in_i -10)\n( <=  in_i 10)\n```\n\nThen the t constraints:\n```\n( >=  t -100)\n( <=  t 100)\n```\n\nThen all not-equality constraints of sums to t.\n\nNote: In the example constraints for N=8 and N=12, the ordering of constraints in the assertion is:\n\nFirst all variable range constraints (in0..inN-1), then t range constraints.\n\nThen the (not (= ... t )) for all contiguous sums starting at 0.\n\nThen for starting at 1, all contiguous sums.\n\n...\n\nThen starting at N-1, only `in_(N-1)` itself.\n\nSo the constraints are grouped by start index ascending, while sums are from largest span to smallest? Or smallest to largest? From the example: For start=0 and N=8:\n\n- (not (= in0 t))\n- (not (= (+ in1 in0) t))\n- (not (= (+ in2 (+ in1 in0)) t))\n- (not (= (+ in3 (+ in2 (+ in1 in0))) t))\n- ...\n- (not (= (+ in7 (+ in6 (+ in5 (+ in4 (+ in3 (+ in2 (+ in1 in0))))))) t))\n\nSo from shortest sums (size 1) to longest sums (size N-start).\n\nSame is true for other start indices.\n\nSo for each start, the sums go from shortest (length=1) to longest (length=N-start).\n\nLet's write the code generating these constraints:\n\nFor i from 0 to N-1 (start index)\n  For length from 1 to N - i  (number of terms in sum)\n    sum = in_i ... in_(i+length-1)\n\nBuild nested pluses with right associativity (as in example).\n\nAdd `(not (= sum t))` constraint.\n\nFor example, sum from in0..in2 is:\n\n```\n( +  in2 ( +  in1 in0))\n```\n\nNested this way: rightmost addition inner, outer to left.\n\nSo for sum: in0 + in1 + in2, we nest as `( +  in2 ( +  in1 in0))`\n\nAlso note spacing exact: `( +  in2 ( +  in1 in0))`\n\nAll operators and operands have two spaces after `(` and one space between operands.\n\nFinal Step: Combine everything with (assert (and ...))\n\nNow I can write the full string.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n(assert (and  ( >=  in0 -10)  ( <=  in0 10)  ( >=  in1 -10)  ( <=  in1 10)  ( >=  in2 -10)  ( <=  in2 10)  ( >=  in3 -10)  ( <=  in3 10)  ( >=  in4 -10)  ( <=  in4 10)

The inputs are named sequentially from in0 to inN-1.\n\nThe pattern for N=3 shows direct pairwise comparisons:\n\nN=3:\n(assert (and (and (and ...) ...)))\nBut easier form: (assert (and (<= in0 in1) (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2)))\n\nN=15 and N=27 both show a hierarchical sorting network or merge sort tree pattern:\n- Inputs split into halves (for example for N=15, inputs 0-7 and 8-14)\n- Sorting/merging of smaller groups, then merging the halves by comparing the left group with the right group.\n\nLooking at N=15:\nGroups of length 2 compared internally (<= in0 in1), then groups of length 4 combined by internal and cross comparisons, then groups of length 8 merged with cross comparisons.\n\nSimilarly for N=27:\nThe inputs are split into:\n- in0...in6 (7 elements)\n- in7...in13 (7 elements)\n- in14...in20 (7 elements)\n- in21...in26 (6 elements)\n\nWithin each group, merge-sort-like comparisons occur. Then bigger groups merge together.\n\nFor N=28, we can expect a similar approach:\n\n- Possibly split into two groups of size 14: in0..in13 and in14..in27.\n- Each 14-element group is itself recursively sorted by similar logic, which (based on the pattern for N=15) is done by smaller merges.\n\nGiven that N=15 uses a two-level approach (split into 8 and 7, or 7 and 8?), and N=27 has further splits into smaller groups, N=28 (an even number) would presumably split into two groups of 14 inputs each.\n\nSo the total set would be:\n\n- Sort in0..in13\n- Sort in14..in27\n- Merge these two sorted sublists by comparing all elements of the first sublist to all elements of the second sublist, meaning (<= in_i in_j) for all i in 0..13 and for all j in 14..27.\n\nThe constraints for sorting a group of 14 inputs is similar to N=15 but for 14 inputs:\n\nFrom N=15, the pattern was recursive merges of halves:\n\nFor N=14, we can infer similarly to N=15, just with one fewer element.\n\nWe should generate the constraints for N=28 as follows:\n\n1. Recursive calls for the first half: constraints for inputs in0..in13.\n2. Recursive calls for the second half: constraints for inputs in14..in27.\n3. Cross constraints: all (<= in_i in_j) for i in 0..13 and j in 14..27.\n\nBut since the problem requests the final SMT constraint string following the pattern, not recursion, we must explicitly write all constraints combined in nested 'and' clauses as shown.\n\nSo let's try to structure it:\n\n- Each half adds constraints as nested 'and' expressions.\n- The cross constraints are flat (<= in_i in_j) for i in [0..13], j in [14..27].\n\nTo generate the sorting constraints for 14 elements (N=14), let's analyze the existing N=15 snippet and remove the constraints involving in14 (last element).\n\nLooking at N=15 constraints, the first half goes from in0..in7, second half in8..in14.\n\nFor N=14, perhaps split into 7 and 7 elements as in N=27 first two groups.\n\nN=14 sort group can follow the same pattern as N=27 groups of size 7:\n\nOn N=27, the 7-element group constraints are:\n\n( <= in0 in1), (<= in2 in3), (<= in0 in2), (<= in1 in2), \n(<= in4 in5), (<= in4 in6), (<= in5 in6), \n(<= in0 in4), (<= in1 in4), (<= in2 in4), (<= in3 in4)\n\nThese are the basic building blocks for 7 elements.\n\nThen the merging of two groups builds on that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For the first 14 elements:\n   - Treat as two groups of 7: in0..in6 and in7..in13, apply the pattern for 7 elements on each group, then merge.\n\n- For the last 14 elements (in14..in27):\n   - Also split into two 7-element groups: in14..in20 and in21..in27 similarly.\n\n- Then merge these two sorted groups (of 14 each) by cross comparisons (<= in_i in_j) for i in 0..13 and j in 14..27.\n\nImplementing all these constraints as nested (and (...)) clauses following the style of N=27 constraints.\n\n-- Step 1: Define a helper for 7-element sorting constraints (like a 7-node sorting network) applied to specific index ranges:\n\nFor a group starting at base:\n\n(<= in_base in_base+1)\n(<= in_base+2 in_base+3)\n(<= in_base in_base+2)\n(<= in_base+1 in_base+2)\n(<= in_base+4 in_base+5)\n(<= in_base+4 in_base+6)\n(<= in_base+5 in_base+6)\n(<= in_base in_base+4)\n(<= in_base+1 in_base+4)\n(<= in_base+2 in_base+4)\n(<= in_base+3 in_base+4)\n\n-- Step 2: Merge two 7-element groups (group1 [base1..base1+6], group2 [base2..base2+6]):\n\n(<= base1+7+0 base1+7+1) (<= similar pairs) and cross comparisons ensuring the merge.\n\nFrom N=27 snippet, merging two 7-element groups lead to constraints like:\n\n(<= base1 in base2), (<= base1+1 in base2), ..., (<= base1+6 in base2)\n\nand combinations of inner & cross comparisons.\n\n-- Step 3: Use the pattern twice to create two sorted 14-element groups.\n\n-- Step 4: Merge the two 14-element groups by cross comparisons between all elements of the first group and all elements of the second group.\n\nThe final top-level is (assert (and ...)).\n\nWe need to write all the constraints explicitly.\n\n---\n\nLet's start building the 7-element group constraints function, for indices from b:\n\n( <= inb   inb+1 )\n( <= inb+2 inb+3 )\n( <= inb   inb+2 )\n( <= inb+1 inb+2 )\n( <= inb+4 inb+5 )\n( <= inb+4 inb+6 )\n( <= inb+5 inb+6 )\n( <= inb   inb+4 )\n( <= inb+1 inb+4 )\n( <= inb+2 inb+4 )\n( <= inb+3 inb+4 )\n\nApply this to:\n\n- Group A: b=0 (in0..in6)\n- Group B: b=7 (in7..in13)\n- Group C: b=14 (in14..in20)\n- Group D: b=21 (in21..in27)\n\nThen merge each pair:\n\n- Merge A and B into M1 (sorted in0..in13)\n- Merge C and D into M2 (sorted in14..in27)\n\nMerging 14 elements (two groups of 7):\n\nOn N=27, the merge for two 7-element groups is:\n\n(<=  base of left group in base of right group) ... (all elements of group1 <= all elements of group2)\n\nAnd additional cross constraints:\n\nFrom N=27, between groups, constraints like:\n\n(<= in0 in7)\n(<= in1 in7)\n...\n(<= in6 in7)\n\nand similarly for other inputs.\n\nWe can replicate this pattern as for N=27:\n\nFor the pairs we merge:\n\n- For A and B:\n  - (<= in0 in7)\n  - (<= in1 in7)\n  - ...\n  - (<= in6 in7)\n  - Also (<= in2 in3) etc inside groups and merging constraints.\n\nSimilarly for C and D.\n\nFinally, we need to merge M1 and M2 by cross constraints:\n\n(<= in_i in_j) for i in 0..13, j in 14..27.\n\n---\n\nNow let's write down all constraints in the nested (and ...) format.\n\nWe start from bottom:\n\n- Define 7-element sort group constraints.\n- Define merge constraints between those groups.\n- Finally, top-level cross merge between two 14-element groups.\n\nNote: Since the prompt says to output exact canonical SMT-LIB format without extra commentary, I will follow the pattern from the example, with nested '(and ...)' groups tightly.\n\nThe challenge is to correctly nest 'and' groups and write all constraint s expressions.\n\n---\n\nStep-by-step SMT-LIB for N=28:\n\n(Top level)\n(assert (and \n  (and \n    ; constraints for first 14 elements (in0..in13)\n    (and\n      ; sort first group 7 (in0..in6)\n      (and (<= in0 in1) (<= in2 in3))\n      (and (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2))\n      (and (<= in4 in5) (<= in4 in6))\n      (and (<= in5 in6))\n      (and (<= in0 in4) (<= in1 in4))\n      (and (<= in2 in4) (<= in3 in4))\n    )\n    (and\n      ; sort second group 7 (in7..in13)\n      (and (<= in7 in8) (<= in9 in10))\n      (and (<= in7 in9) (<= in8 in9))\n      (and (<= in11 in12) (<= in11 in13))\n      (and (<= in12 in13))\n      (and (<= in7 in11) (<= in8 in11))\n      (and (<= in9 in11) (<= in10 in11))\n    )\n    (and\n      ; merge of two 7-element groups into first 14\n      (<= in0 in7)\n      (<= in1 in7)\n      (<= in2 in7)\n      (<= in3 in7)\n      (<= in4 in7)\n      (<= in5 in7)\n      (<= in6 in7)\n    )\n  )\n  (and \n    ; constraints for second 14 elements (in14..in27)\n    (and\n      ; sort third group 7 (in14..in20)\n      (and (<= in14 in15) (<= in16 in17))\n      (and (<= in14 in16) (<= in15 in16))\n      (and (<= in18 in19) (<= in18 in20))\n      (and (<= in19 in20))\n      (and (<= in14 in18) (<= in15 in18))\n      (and (<= in16 in18) (<= in17 in18))\n    )\n    (and\n      ; sort fourth group 7 (in21..in27)\n      (and (<= in21 in22) (<= in23 in24))\n      (and (<= in21 in23) (<= in22 in23))\n      (and (<= in25 in26) (<= in25 in27))\n      (and (<= in26 in27))\n      (and (<= in21 in25) (<= in22 in25))\n      (and (<= in23 in25) (<= in24 in25))\n    )\n    (and\n      ; merge of two 7-element groups into second 14\n      (<= in21 in25)\n      (<= in22 in25)\n      (<= in23 in25)\n      (<= in24 in25)\n      (<= in25 in25) ; redundant?

Let's carefully check indices.\n\n      Actually, from N=27 constraints, for the merge between 7-element groups, similar constraints to the first merge (all elements <= first element of next group).\n\n      For the second group, likely constraints:\n\n      (<= in21 in25)\n      (<= in22 in25)\n      (<= in23 in25)\n      (<= in24 in25) \n      (<= in21 ..., to with careful mapping)\n\n      Actually I notice in N=27 ( <= in21 in22) (<= in21 in23) etc for internal sorting, so let's follow the pattern:\n\n      Since the second group is in21..in27, the 7-elements subgroups are in21..in27 (7 elements):\n\n      inside subgroup sort constraints are given above, now merge constraints:\n\n      For second 14 merge, between two 7-element groups in21..in27 (first 7 inputs) and  in28 onwards do not exist since N=28.\n\n      No, group D is in21..in27 (7 elements), no further split.\n\n      So just internal sorting within D is enough, no further merge constraints.\n\n    )\n  )\n  ; Finally cross-merge constraints between first 14 and second 14:\n  (and\n    (<= in0 in14) (<= in0 in15) (<= in0 in16) (<= in0 in17) (<= in0 in18) (<= in0 in19) (<= in0 in20) (<= in0 in21) (<= in0 in22) (<= in0 in23) (<= in0 in24) (<= in0 in25) (<= in0 in26) (<= in0 in27)\n    (<= in1 in14) (<= in1 in15) (<= in1 in16) (<= in1 in17) (<= in1 in18) (<= in1 in19) (<= in1 in20) (<= in1 in21) (<= in1 in22) (<= in1 in23) (<= in1 in24) (<= in1 in25) (<= in1 in26) (<= in1 in27)\n    ...\n    (<= in13 in14) (<= in13 in15) ... (<= in13 in27)\n  )\n))\n\nBut the problem's N=27 example nests all constraints within multiple (and (and ...)) expressions for 2 at a time.\n\nOur above plan is to nest ands for pairs.\n\nTo follow the exact canonical format, I will proceed recursively nesting (and (and ...)) expressions for every pair of constraints.\n\nFor a large number of constraints, typical approach is to build a balanced binary tree of 'and' expressions grouping constraints two at a time, ultimately beneath the top-level (assert (and ...)).\n\nBecause this is long, to simplify and avoid errors, let's limit nesting by grouping controls into pairs at all levels.\n\n---\n\nTo avoid errors, I will encode the constraints as a flat list and build the nested 'and' pairing from left to right.\n\nDefine helper to create nested pairwise (and x y) from a list [c1, c2, ..., cn]:\n\n- start from left, pair c1 and c2: (and c1 c2)\n- then pair result with c3: (and (and c1 c2) c3)\n- then pair result with c4: etc.\n\nThis generates deeply left nested (and ...) as in the examples.\n\n---\n\nNow expressions needed:\n\n1. All 7-element group sort constraints (11 constraints per group).\n\n2. Merge constraints of the two 7-element groups to get 14 elements (for first half inputs and second half inputs).\n\n3. Cross constraints between first 14 and second 14.\n\nCalculate total number of constraints:\n\n- Each 7-element group: 11 constraints per group. 4 groups => 44 constraints.\n\n- Merge constraints of first 14 (two 7 groups): From N=27, merging two 7-element groups involves just (<= in_i in_j) constraints where i in first group (0..6) <= first element of second group (7). 7 constraints.\n\n- Same for second 14 (two 7 groups): same 7 constraints.\n\n- Cross constraints between first 14 and second 14: 14 * 14 = 196 constraints.\n\nTotal constraints = 44 + 7 + 7 + 196 = 254 constraints\n\nSo now creating 254 constraints nested by (and ...) accordingly.\n\n---\n\nI will write the explicit SMT string for each constraint and then nested pairwise join all constraints with (and ...).\n\nTo do this:\n\n- Create list of all constraints strings.\n\n- For each constraint, format as (<= inX inY)\n\n- Then nest pairwise with (and ...)\n\n- Wrap with (assert (and ....))\n\nBecause the problem wants exact canonical format without extra commentary in the final answer, I will output just the nested (assert (and ...)) string.\n\n---\n\nLet's do it.\n\nDefine function to create 7-element group constraints for base b:\n\n(<= inb inb+1)\n(<= inb+2 inb+3)\n(<= inb inb+2)\n(<= inb+1 inb+2)\n(<= inb+4 inb+5)\n(<= inb+4 inb+6)\n(<= inb+5 inb+6)\n(<= inb inb+4)\n(<= inb+1 inb+4)\n(<= inb+2 inb+4)\n(<= inb+3 inb+4)\n\nDo that for b in [0,7,14,21]\n\nCreate merge constraints for two 7-element groups:\n\nFor base1 and base2 = base1+7\n\n(<= in_base1 in_base2 )\n(<= in_base1+1 in_base2)\n(<= in_base1+2 in_base2)\n(<= in_base1+3 in_base2)\n(<= in_base1+4 in_base2)\n(<= in_base1+5 in_base2)\n(<= in_base1+6 in_base2)\n\nSo for first merge:\n\n(<= in0 in7) .. (<= in6 in7)\n\nSecond merge:\n\n(<= in14 in21) .. (<= in20 in21)\n\nFinally cross merges between in0..in13 and in14..in27:\n\n(<= in_i in_j) for i in 0..13, j in 14..27 (196 constraints).\n\n---\n\nCollect the constraints in a list in this order:\n\n- 7-element group constraints for group A (b=0)\n- 7-element group constraints for group B (b=7)\n- merge constraints for first 14 (b=0,7)\n- 7-element group constraints for group C (b=14)\n- 7-element group constraints for group D (b=21)\n- merge constraints for second 14 (b=14,21)\n- cross merge constraints: in0..in13 <= in14..in27\n\nThen nest all by left-associative (and ...).\n\n---\n\nNote: For the cross merge constraints, for i=0..13 and j=14..27.\n\nin14..in27 means indices 14 to 27 inclusive, total 14 elements.\n\nSimilarly for i in 0 to 13 inclusive =>14 elements, total constraints =14*14=196.\n\n---\n\nNow proceed to write the final SMT-LIB constraint string accordingly.\n\nNote: I'll use symbolic variables in terms of 'in{index}' as the examples show.\n\nFor example constraint: (<= in0 in1) is \"(<= in0 in1)\"\n\nAll operators and spacing will follow the examples, exactly as:\n\n( <=  in0 in1 )\n\nSpaces after \"( <=\" and before operands and

Our constraint for N=25 would be the same but adding for in24 the same 5 constraints.\n\nHence for N=25 the output must be:\n\n(assert (and\n   ... constraints for in0 ...\n   ... constraints for in1 ...\n   ...\n   ... constraints for in23 ...\n   ... constraints for in24 ...\n))\n\nThe exact format is nested `(and ...)` pairs for combining all.\n\nObserving N=14 and N=24 formats, the nesting is done by repeated `(and)` pairing of constraints and then joining those by many nested `(and)`.\n\nThe detailed pattern for one variable `inX` is exactly the same 5 constraints joined by `(and ...)`. For e.g. for in0:\n\n`(and (not (= in0 1)) (= (mod in0 2) 0) (not (= (div in0 2) 1)) (= (mod (div in0 2) 2) 0) (not (= (div (div in0 2) 2) 1)))`\n\nBut the examples simplify to use just two at a time to join multiple constraints, nesting `(and ...)` progressively.\n\nIn the examples, the nesting is deeply left-associative, e.g.:\n\n(and \n  (and \n     (and \n        (and (c1 c2) c3) c4) c5)\n  (and (constraints for other variables)...)\n)\n\nSo to respect the exact canonical format, for each variable we first form:\n\n(and (not (= inX 1)) (= (mod inX 2) 0)) \u2192 A1\n\n(and A1 (not (= (div inX 2) 1))) \u2192 A2\n\n(and A2 (= (mod (div inX 2) 2) 0)) \u2192 A3\n\n(and A3 (not (= (div (div inX 2) 2) 1))) \u2192 constraint per variable\n\nThen all variable constraints are combined by (and ...) nested similarly.\n\nThe final output should be the complete nested and expressions of all variable constraints for in0 to in24.\n\nWe'll generate the full expression for N=25

Inside each group, constraints follow a similar pattern, and again cross-group constraints `(<= in0 in4)`, `(<= in1 in4)`, `(<= in2 in4)`, `(<= in3 in4)` are added.\n\n- For **larger N**, like N=14, N=19, N=27, the pattern is hierarchical: the inputs are split recursively into smaller groups, which are ordered internally with all the pairwise constraints needed for that group, and then constraints are added to order groups with respect to the next level groups (cross-group constraints).\n\nTherefore, the structure resembles a balanced or quasi-balanced tree, where variables are grouped recursively, ordered within groups, and ordered according to the tree structure.\n\n----\n\n**Specific observations about N=27 constraints:**\n\n- N=27 is split into groups like so:\n  - `(in0..in6)` group\n  - `(in7..in13)` group\n  - `(in14..in20)` group\n  - `(in21..in26)` group\n\nEach group gets the same pattern of constraints as in smaller N, then the groups themselves are linked via cross-group constraints -- e.g., `(<= in0 in14)`, `(<= in1 in14)`, ..., meaning the first big group `<` second big group, etc.\n\n----\n\n**For N=28:**\n\nSince the prior number is 27, and the pattern shows that splitting tends to happen in powers of two balanced roughly or into groups of similar size, for 28, we can suspect a similar hierarchical grouping pattern, just extended to include the 28th variable.\n\nN=28 is 27+1, so the strategy would likely be to keep the groups used in N=27 and add the last variable `in27` into an existing group, or possibly create a new group of size 1 that is ordered last.\n\nSince 28 is not a power of two, but 28 = 14 +14, it makes sense to split into two big groups each of size 14:\n\n- Left group: `in0` to `in13` (14 variables)\n- Right group: `in14` to `in27` (14 variables)\n\nFor each group of 14, the constraints for N=14 apply (which is given).\n\nThen, cross-group constraints will be from all variables in the left group (0..13) to all variables in the right group (14..27), as per the pattern seen in N=14 and N=27.\n\n----\n\n**Step 1: Encode groups [0..13] and [14..27]**\n\nFor the group [0..13], use the N=14 constraints given.\n\nVariables: `in0`...`in13`\n\nThe N=14 constraints given are:\n\n```\n( <=  in0 in1)\n( <=  in2 in3)\n( <=  in0 in2)\n( <=  in1 in2)\n( <=  in4 in5)\n( <=  in4 in6)\n( <=  in5 in6)\n( <=  in0 in4)\n( <=  in1 in4)\n( <=  in2 in4)\n( <=  in3 in4)\n( <=  in7 in8)\n( <=  in9 in10)\n( <=  in7 in9)\n( <=  in8 in9)\n( <=  in11 in12)\n( <=  in11 in13)\n( <=  in12 in13)\n( <=  in7 in11)\n( <=  in8 in11)\n( <=  in9 in11)\n( <=  in10 in11)\n( <=  in0 in7)\n( <=  in1 in7)\n( <=  in2 in7)\n( <=  in3 in7)\n( <=  in4 in7)\n( <=  in5 in7)\n( <=  in6 in7)\n```\n\nFor the group [14..27] (14 variables), we use the same pattern but indices shifted by 14:\n\n- Replace each `inX` with `in(X+14)`\n\nThis forms the internal ordering of the right group.\n\n----\n\n**Step 2: Cross-group constraints**\n\nFrom previous patterns (N=14, 19, 27), cross-group constraints link every variable in the left group (0 to 13) to the first variable of the right group (14):\n\n```\n(<= in0 in14), (<= in1 in14), ..., (<= in13 in14)\n```\n\nThis is consistent with previous patterns where the left group precedes the right group's first element, and via transitivity the ordering extends.\n\n----\n\n**Step 3: Put it all together**\n\nWrap all constraints combined with `(and ...)` and a top-level `(assert (and ...))`.\n\nThe structure is:\n\n```\n(assert (and\n   ; left group constraints (N=14)\n   ...\n   ; right group constraints (N=14 shifted)\n   ...\n   ; cross-group constraints: in0..in13 <= in14\n   ...\n))\n```\n\n----\n\n**Generate the full list:**\n\n**Left group (in0..in13) constraints:**\n\n1.

They are covered by transitivity.\n\nSo the main difference is adding (<= in27 in28) and including in28 in the last group merges.\n\nThus, the final assertion structure for N=29 will mirror the N=28 structure, but with added constraints that (<= in27 in28) and the last group (21..28) adjusted to include in28.\n\nFinally, produce the full nested 'and' expression following the exact style for N=28, but extended for N=29.\n\nNote: The task says \"All per-variable constraints must be combined using a top-level (assert (and ...)) clause,\" and the example uses nested binary 'and's.\n\nSo to format, all individual (<= inX inY) clauses must be binary nested inside multiple (and ...).\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll produce the full nested structure for N=29 accordingly.\n\nThe approach for nested 'and':\n\n- Start from pairs of (<= ...)\n- Pair them and nest them inside (and ... ...)\n- Recurse until all combined under a single (and ...)\n\nDue to the complexity and size, the main new atomic clause for N=29 is (<= in27 in28), and all other constraints copied from N=28.\n\nCombine all atoms into one large nested (and ...).\n\nI will:\n\n- Take all the atoms from N=28\n- Add (<= in27 in28)\n- Combine all atoms with the N=28 nested and structure\n\nBecause the nested 'and' for N=28 includes 69 pairs, I will add just the (<= in27 in28) as a separate atom wrapped into an additional \"and\" at the top-level.\n\nTherefore, the top level will be (assert (and <N=28 nested and> (<= in27 in28)))\n\nBecause the example shows they only do one top-level 'and' for N=5/16/28 including all atoms, I'll add (<= in27 in28) inside that massive 'and'.\n\nGiven that the user has shown the N=28 constraints in full, I will produce the N=29 constraints by embedding the extra atom (<= in27 in28) into the top-level 'and' of N=28 constraints.\n\nFinal answer structure:\n\n(assert (and <N=28 constraints> (<= in27 in28)))\n\nBut since the N=28 constraints is a very deep nested and of all atoms, adding one more atom means an extra (and <N=28_constraints> (<= in27 in28)) wrapper at the top-level.\n\nAlternatively, we can re-nest all atoms which is impractical here. So adding one more (<= in27 in28) at the top-level and wrap it all in one (and ...) should be acceptable.\n\nNo other constraints are needed because sorting of in28 is guaranteed by these constraints.\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n(assert (and \n    (and (and (and ... all N=28 atoms ... )) \n          (<= in27 in28)\n    )\n))\n\nI will now output the entire N=28 atoms plus this extra atom in nested format.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and ( <=  in0 in1)  ( <=  in2 in3))  ( <=  in0 in2))  ( <=  in1 in2))  ( <=  in4 in5))  ( <=  in4 in6))  ( <=  in5 in6))  ( <=  in0 in4))  ( <=  in1 in4))  ( <=  in2 in4))  ( <=  in3 in4))  ( <=  in7 in8))  ( <=  in9 in10))  ( <=  in7 in9))  ( <=  in8 in9))  ( <=  in11 in12))  ( <=  in11 in13))  ( <=  in12 in13))  ( <=  in7 in11))  ( <=  in8 in11))  ( <=  in9 in11))  ( <=  in10 in11))  ( <=  in0 in7))  ( <=  in1 in7))  ( <=  in2 in7))  ( <=  in3 in7))  ( <=  in4 in7))  ( <=  in5 in7))  ( <=  in6 in7))  ( <=  in14 in15))  ( <=  in16 in17))  ( <=  in14 in16))  ( <=  in15 in16))  ( <=  in18 in19))  ( <=  in18 in20))  ( <=  in19 in20))  ( <=  in14 in18))  ( <=  in15 in18))  ( <=  in16 in18))  ( <=  in17 in18))  ( <=  in21 in22))  ( <=  in23 in24))  ( <=  in21 in23))  ( <=  in22 in23))  ( <=  in25 in26))  ( <=  in25 in27))  ( <=  in26 in27))  ( <=  in21 in25))  ( <=  in22 in25))  ( <=  in23 in25))  ( <=  in24 in25))  ( <=  in14 in21))  ( <=  in15 in21))  ( <=  in16 in21))  ( <=  in17 in21))  ( <=  in18 in21))  ( <=  in19 in21))  ( <=  in20 in21))  ( <=  in0 in14))  ( <=  in1 in14))  ( <=  in2 in14))  ( <=  in3 in14))  ( <=  in4 in14))  ( <=  in5 in14))  ( <=  in6 in14))  ( <=  in7 in14))  ( <=  in8 in14))  ( <=  in9 in14))  ( <=  in10 in14))  ( <=  in11 in14))  ( <=  in12 in14))  ( <=  in13 in14)))  ( <=  in27 in28)))</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1359, "completion_tokens": 2353, "total_tokens": 3712, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

0 \u2264 i < j \u2264 18, wrapped properly.\n\nThe form of the output is a nested series of `(and ...)` where the left and right are groups of previous and next constraints, e.g., for N=4 it's nested ands like `(and (and (and (and (...))) ...) ...) ... )`.\n\nWe just need to generate these `( > in_i in_j )` for all pairs i<j and nest them with `(and ...)` in a left-associative manner.\n\nSince the mindset here is to output the exact canonical SMT-LIB format like the examples, I will construct the nested `(and ...)` by starting with the first comparison and iteratively nest the remaining comparisons within `(and ...)`.\n\nTo clarify the nesting with an example of three comparisons A, B, C:\n`(and A (and B C))` or `(and (and A B) C)` both acceptable, but the given examples put every pair inside its own `(and (and ... ) ...)` so the nesting is always binary, left-associative.\n\nLooking at the N=4 example:\n\n- pairs:  \n  > in0 in1  \n  > in0 in2  \n  > in0 in3  \n  > in1 in2  \n  > in1 in3  \n  > in2 in3  \n  \nN=4 example nesting is `(and (and (and (and (and ... )))))`\n\nFor 19 variables, there are (19 * 18) / 2 = 171 pairs.\n\nI will generate all pairs `( > in_i in_j )` for i in [0..17], j in [i+1 ..18], total 171.\n\nThen produce nested `(and ... )` to wrap these.\n\nLet's write out the opening `(assert (and `, then nested `(and (` for each of the 171-1 times (because top level assert(and(...)) counts as one), then the sequence of pairs separated by spaces, then close the parentheses (171 times).\n\nCareful to match the style in examples:\n\nEach pair: `( >  inX inY )` with exactly one space between tokens.\n\nBetween pairs there's a space.\n\nPreceding each pair, an opening `(and (` except the first pair which is inside the first `and`.\n\nSo total of 171 pairs, 171 `(and (` except the innermost is a pair without `(and (` wrapping.\n\nWait, example for N=9:\n\nNumber of pairs = (9*8)/2=36.\n\nNumber of `(and (` nested in that example is 35.\n\nSimilarly, general pattern:\n\n- For P pairs, we have P-1 nested `(and (` at the start.\n\n- Then pairs separated by spaces.\n\n- Then P closing parentheses at the end.\n\nSo for N=19 (171 pairs), there will be 170 `(and (` before the pairs.\n\nI will create a string:\n\n`(assert (and ` + `(and ` repeated 170 times\n\nthen all 171 pairs separated by spaces\n\nthen 171 closing parentheses `)`\n\nI will generate pairs in lex order: (0,1), (0,2), ..., (0,18), (1,2), (1,3), ..., (1,18), (2,3), ..., (17,18)\n\nShow final.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and

( > ... )) but simply inline as (and (and (and (and ... ( >= ... ) ( > ... ) ) ... )\n\nMeaning apparently the top-level assert's (and ...) contains inside pairs of constraints as its arguments.\n\nBut from the N=5 example, we have:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  ( >=  in1 in0)  ( >  in1 in0))  ( >=  in2 in0))  ( >  in2 in0))  ( >=  in2 in1))  ( >  in2 in1)) ... )))))\n\nThe grouping is simply nested (and (and (and ... )), each grouping two expressions, with each expression either a pair of atomic constraints (>= and >) right after each other.\n\nSo the pairs are not explicitly grouped into (and ( >= ... ) ( > ... )) but rather the two atomic constraints are placed consecutively inside the (and ...) nested structures.\n\nSo the nesting pairs two parts, thus we have an odd number of total atomic parts (>= ... and > ... each counts individually) so in the example N=3:\n\nin1 vs in0 has (>= ...) and (> ...), then in2 vs in0 has the same two, then in2 vs in1 has the same two, total 6 atomic clauses combined with nested (and)s pairwise.\n\nTherefore, for N=12, we should output:\n\n(assert (and ...)) with nested (and)s pairwise combining all atomic constraints:\n\nFor each i=1..11, for each j=0..i-1:\n\nAdd: (>= in{i} in{j})  ( >  in{i} in{j})\n\nwith a total of 66*2=132 atomic constraints.\n\nThen nest them pairwise using (and expr1 expr2) until one top-level remains.\n\nTherefore, we have 132 atomic constraints.\n\nWe can code a left fold of the constraints combined pairwise with (and ...), for instance:\n\nstart = (>= in1 in0)\n\nfor each next in the list:\n\nstart = (and start next)\n\nBut we need pairs (and of two), so we combine them two at a time from the left.\n\nExample for first few constraints:\n\nlet c1 = (>= in1 in0)\n\nlet c2 = (> in1 in0)\n\nfirst and block: (and c1 c2)\n\nnext c3 = (>= in2 in0)\n\nnext c4 = (> in2 in0)\n\nnext and block: (and (and c1 c2) c3) ?\n\nBut from examples, the nesting is deeper: (and (and (and ... with each (and ...) combining exactly two elements.\n\nTherefore, the structure is:\n\n(and\n  (and\n    (and\n      ...\n        (and (and ( >= in1 in0)( > in1 in0)) \n             (and ( >= in2 in0) (> in2 in0))\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nHence, each pair of atomic constraints is wrapped as (and ( >= ... ) ( > ... )) then these pairs are combined pairwise with (and ... ), recursively.\n\nThat is, first build list P of pairs (and ( >= ... ) ( > ... ))\n\nThen fold left over P with (and ... ) to nest the entire thing.\n\nThen wrap with top-level (assert ...).\n\nThis matches the style in example N=3 and others, where pairs of (>= x y) and (> x y) are grouped with (and ...), then the pairs themselves combined with nested ands.\n\nCheck N=3 example once again:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and  ( >=  in1 in0)  ( >  in1 in0))  ( >=  in2 in0))  ( >  in2 in0))  ( >=  in2 in1))  ( >  in2 in1)))\n\nHere the first (and ... ) groups (>= in1 in0) and (> in1 in0), then this with next (>= in2 in0), then with (> in2 in0), etc.\n\nSo it seems pairs of constraints (>= and >) are just placed sequentially as arguments to nested ands, not grouped as (and (>= ... ) (> ... )) blocks.\n\nWait. The example actually the outermost and has as children 5 'ands' nested:\n\nFor N=3 total of 6 atomic constraints for pairs:\n\n- >= in1 in0\n\n- > in1 in0\n\n- >= in2 in0\n\n- > in2 in0\n\n- >= in2 in1\n\n- > in2 in1\n\nThe nesting combines these 6 constraints as (and (and (and (and (and ... )))))\n\nIf we count parentheses for N=3 example:\n\n(assert (and\n  (and \n    (and \n      (and\n        (and  ( >=  in1 in0)  ( >  in1 in0))\n        ( >=  in2 in0))\n      ( >  in2 in0))\n    ( >=  in2 in1))\n  ( >  in2 in1)))\n\nThe example is consistently pairing 2 expressions inside the innermost and, then nesting.\n\nSo it seems each 'and' combines the next two expressions one by one.\n\nHence:\n\nWe can consider the list of atomic expressions as a flat list:\n\n[(>= in1 in0), (> in1 in0), (>= in2 in0), (> in2 in0), (>= in2 in1), (> in2 in1), ...]\n\nThen, from left to right, we combine pairs of expressions as (and expr1 expr2), then combine these and's again pairwise with other expressions.\n\nThis process is a left fold with (and ...).\n\nTo emulate the nested and's, we build them from bottom-up as deeply as possible when combining the expressions left-to-right.\n\nGiven the examples simply nest them deeply left associatively.\n\nGiven the complexity, we will interpret the example as simply:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and ... ( >= ...) (> ...) ... )))))\n\nA huge nesting of (and (and ... )) pairs combining all expressions in order.\n\nTherefore, for N=12, we produce a nested and chain, combining each expression (atomic constraint) one by one.\n\nTotal expressions = 132\n\nTherefore, start with first expression:\n\ne1 = (>= in1 in0)\n\nCombine e1 and e2 = (> in1 in0) as (and e1 e2)\n\nThen combine with e3 = (>= in2 in0) as (and (and e1 e2) e3)\n\nThen with e4 = (> in2 in0) as (and (and (and e1 e2) e3) e4)\n\nContinue in this way until all 132 expressions are nested.\n\nThe fully nested chain will look like:\n\n(assert (and (and (and ... (and ( >= in1 in0) (> in1 in0) ) (>= in2 in0)) ( > in2 in0)) ... ))\n\nThis matches the example's syntax.\n\nWe will produce the output following this style for N=12.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and ( >=  in1 in0)  ( >  in1 in0))  ( >=  in2 in0))  ( >  in2 in0))  ( >=  in2 in1))  ( >  in2 in1))  ( >=  in3 in0))  ( >  in3 in0))  ( >=  in3 in1))  ( >  in3 in1))  ( >=  in3 in2))  ( >  in3 in2))  ( >=  in4 in0))  ( >  in4 in0))  ( >=  in4 in1))  ( >  in4 in1))  ( >=  in4 in2))  ( >  in4 in2))  ( >=  in4 in3))  ( >  in4 in3))  ( >=  in5 in0))  ( >  in5 in0))  ( >=  in5 in1))  ( >  in5 in1))  ( >=  in5 in2))  ( >  in5 in2))  ( >=  in5 in3))  ( >  in5 in3))  ( >=  in5 in4))  ( >  in5 in4))  ( >=  in6 in0))  ( >  in6 in0))  ( >=  in6 in1))  ( >  in6 in1))  ( >=  in6 in2))  ( >  in6 in2))  ( >=  in6 in3))  ( >  in6 in3))  ( >=  in6 in4))  ( >  in6 in4))  ( >=  in6 in5))  ( >  in6 in5))  ( >=  in7 in0))  ( >  in7 in0))  ( >=  in7 in1))  ( >  in7 in1))  ( >=  in7 in2))  ( >  in7 in2))  ( >=  in7 in3))  ( >  in7 in3))  ( >=  in7 in4))  ( >  in7 in4))  ( >=  in7 in5))  ( >  in7 in5))  ( >=  in7 in6))  ( >  in7 in6))  ( >=  in8 in0))  ( >  in8 in0))  ( >=  in8 in1))  ( >  in8 in1))  ( >=  in8 in2))  ( >  in8 in2))  ( >=  in8 in3))  ( >  in8 in3))  ( >=  in8 in4))  ( >  in8 in4))  ( >=  in8 in5))  ( >  in8 in5))  ( >=  in8 in6))  ( >  in8 in6))  ( >=  in8 in7))  ( >  in8 in7))  ( >=  in9 in0))  ( >  in9 in0))  ( >=  in9 in1))  ( >  in9 in1))  ( >=  in9 in2))  ( >  in9 in2))  ( >=  in9 in3))  ( >  in9 in3))  ( >=  in9 in4))  ( >  in9 in4))  ( >=  in9 in5))  ( >  in9 in5))  ( >=  in9 in6))  ( >  in9 in6))  ( >=  in9 in7))  ( >  in9 in7))  ( >=  in9 in8))  ( >  in9 in8))  ( >=  in10 in0))  ( >  in10 in0))  ( >=  in10 in1))  ( >  in10 in1))  ( >=  in10 in2))  ( >  in10 in2))  ( >=  in10 in3))  ( >  in10 in3))  ( >=  in10 in4))  ( >  in10 in4))  ( >=  in10 in5))  ( >  in10 in5))  ( >=  in10 in6))  ( >  in10 in6))  ( >=  in10 in7))  ( >  in10 in7))  ( >=  in10 in8))  ( >  in10 in8))  ( >=  in10 in9))  ( >  in10 in9))  ( >=  in11 in0))  ( >  in11 in0))  ( >=  in11 in1))  ( >  in11 in1))  ( >=  in11 in2))  ( >  in11 in2))  ( >=  in11 in3))  ( >  in11 in3))  ( >=  in11 in4))  ( >  in11 in4))  ( >=  in11 in5))  ( >  in11 in5))  ( >=  in11 in6))  ( >  in11 in6))  ( >=  in11 in7))  ( >  in11 in7))  ( >=  in11 in8))  ( >  in11 in8))  ( >=  in11 in9))  ( >  in11 in9))  ( >=  in11 in10))  ( >  in11 in10)))))\n</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2368, "completion_tokens": 3732, "total_tokens": 6100, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

Inputs are inN, from in0 to in(N-1).\n\n2. The constraints relate the inputs in groups and subgroups, maintaining ordering within groups and between groups.\n\n3. There is a recursive grouping pattern, generally grouping inputs into clusters of size around 2 or 3, and adding ordering constraints within clusters and between clusters.\n\n4. The roots of these clusters are linked with ordering constraints on the inputs.\n\n5. The constraints form a partial order that looks like a sorting network or merging network (like a merge tree).\n\n6. The examples show nested (and (and ...)) structure, but the final output must have all constraints in a single top-level (assert (and ...)) clause.\n\n7. The output must be canonical SMT-LIB with all constraints combined at the top-level.\n\nExamining examples:\n\n- For small N, the merging tends to compare groups of input indices.\n\n- For example, N=6 groups: (in0,in1,in2) and (in3,in4,in5) with constraints on those groups and cross-group constraints joining in0-in3, in1-in3, in2-in3, etc.\n\n- For larger N, constraints apply recursively to subgroups of inputs.\n\n- N=19 gives a complex pattern with groups of size 5 or 6 being merged.\n\nGoal: Generate constraints for N=23 following similar logic.\n\n--\n\nLet's examine the example for N=19 to help guide N=23 generation:\n\nN=19 (indices 0..18) groups:\n\n- Group1: in0..in4 (5 elements)\n\n- Group2: in5..in9 (5 elements)\n\n- Group3: in10..in14 (5 elements)\n\n- Group4: in15..in18 (4 elements)\n\nThen constraints inside groups and cross-group linking between groups.\n\nThis suggests that for N=23, groupings will be similar but adjusted:\n\n23 can be split roughly into groups of 6 elements:\n\n23 divided into 4 groups:\n\n- Group1: in0..in5 (6 elem)\n\n- Group2: in6..in11 (6 elem)\n\n- Group3: in12..in17 (6 elem)\n\n- Group4: in18..in22 (5 elem)\n\nNow, from the examples, constraints inside each group maintain ordering constraints as in the small groups.\n\nBetween groups, the constraints relate the roots of the groups.\n\nWe need to create:\n\n- Within-group ordering constraints\n\n- Cross-group ordering constraints ensuring the tree merges properly.\n\n--\n\nFollowing the pattern:\n\n- For group sizes 5 or 6, the inner ordering constraints are like in previous examples.\n\n- For 6 elements: something like ( <= in0 in1), ( <= in0 in2), ( <= in1 in2), ( <= in3 in4), ( <= in3 in5), ( <= in4 in5), ( <= in0 in3), ( <= in1 in3), ( <= in2 in3)\n\n- For 5 elements: similar to the N=11 groupings.\n\nLet's generate per group the constraints following known patterns.\n\nGroup1: in0..in5 (6 elements)\n\nFrom N=6 example, constraints inside group of size 6:\n\n(<= in0 in1)\n\n(<= in0 in2)\n\n(<= in1 in2)\n\n(<= in3 in4)\n\n(<= in3 in5)\n\n(<= in4 in5)\n\n(<= in0 in3)\n\n(<= in1 in3)\n\n(<= in2 in3)\n\nGroup2: in6..in11 (6 elements)\n\nSame pattern with indices shifted by 6:\n\n(<= in6 in7)\n\n(<= in6 in8)\n\n(<= in7 in8)\n\n(<= in9 in10)\n\n(<= in9 in11)\n\n(<= in10 in11)\n\n(<= in6 in9)\n\n(<= in7 in9)\n\n(<= in8 in9)\n\nGroup3: in12..in17 (6 elements)\n\nSame pattern shifted by 12:\n\n(<= in12 in13)\n\n(<= in12 in14)\n\n(<= in13 in14)\n\n(<= in15 in16)\n\n(<= in15 in17)\n\n(<= in16 in17)\n\n(<= in12 in15)\n\n(<= in13 in15)\n\n(<= in14 in15)\n\nGroup4: in18..in22 (5 elements)\n\nFrom the pattern for groups of 5 (N=11 or N=19), example constraints are:\n\nFor (in0 in1 in2 in3 in4), the group constraints:\n\n(<= in0 in1)\n\n(<= in0 in2)\n\n(<= in1 in2)\n\n(<= in3 in4)\n\n(<= in0 in3)\n\n(<= in1 in3)\n\n(<= in2 in3)\n\nLet's create for in18..in22:\n\n(<= in18 in19)\n\n(<= in18 in20)\n\n(<= in19 in20)\n\n(<= in21 in22)\n\n(<= in18 in21)\n\n(<= in19 in21)\n\n(<= in20 in21)\n\n--\n\nNow cross-group merges.\n\nHow do groups merge?\n\nFrom examples, for groups g1 and g2, constraints include:\n\n- Ordering within first group\n\n- Ordering within second group\n\n- Ordering between groups: constraints like (<= in0 in6), (<= in1 in6), ..., ensuring the whole combined group is ordered.\n\nFrom N=19 example, the cross-group merges are done by imposing constraints like:\n\n- (<= minima in roots of higher groups)\n\nExample:\n\nBetween group1 (0..4) and group2 (5..9):\n\n(<= in5 in8)\n\n(<= in5 in7)\n\n(<= in6 in8)\n\nBut in general, there is a pattern to ensure ordering of group1 <= group2 <= group3 <= group4.\n\nTo keep consistency, we need the following cross-group constraints:\n\n- For merging group1 (0..5) with group2 (6..11):\n\nFor consistency with previous examples, constraints from all elements of group1 to group2's root (in6, say):\n\nBut from examples, the lower group elements are constrained to be <= some root of the higher group.\n\nIn previous examples, the third element of lower group to first element of higher group.\n\nSo (<= in0 in6), (<= in1 in6), ..., (<= in5 in6)\n\nSimilarly, after merging group1 and group2, merge with group3:\n\n(<= in0 in12), (<= in1 in12), ..., (<= in5 in12)\n\n(<= in6 in12), ..., (<= in11 in12)\n\nSimilarly, group4 merged after group3:\n\n(<= in0 in18), ..., (<= in5 in18)\n\n(<= in6 in18), ..., (<= in11 in18)\n\n(<= in12 in18), ..., (<= in17 in18)\n\nIs this consistent with previous patterns?\n\nYes, from N=19 example, earlier groups elements (like in0..in4) are <= in10 which is the minimal element of the next group.\n\nSimilarly, other groups merge upward.\n\nIn short, cross-group constraints ensure all elements in earlier groups are <= root element of the next group.\n\nFinally:\n\n- For group 1: no extra cross-group constraints (internal constraints only)\n\n- For merging with group 2: all in0..in5 <= in6 (lowest element of group2)\n\n- For merging with group 3: all in0..in11 <= in12 (lowest element of group3)\n\n- For merging with group 4: all in0..in17 <= in18 (lowest element of group4)\n\nThese follow the \"merge tree\" pattern.\n\n------\n\nComplete constraint list for N=23:\n\nInternal constraints of each group:\n\nGroup1: in0..in5\n\n(<= in0 in1)\n\n(<= in0 in2)\n\n(<= in1 in2)\n\n(<= in3 in4)\n\n(<= in3

in18)\n\n(<= in17 in18)\n\n--\n\nThis should be the complete set of constraints.\n\nNow, combine all constraints into a single (assert (and ...)) expression, with each constraint in the format:\n\n(<= inX inY)\n\nFollowing exact SMT-LIB canonical format from examples, e.g.,\n\n(assert (and  ( <=  in0 in1)  ( <=  in0 in2) ... ))\n\nNote that spacing is two spaces before \"<=\", then single space before each argument (variable names), and spaces between constraints.\n\nWe'll produce exactly like this.\n\nThis is consistent with the examples.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and  ( <=  in0 in1)

Then a series of `(not (= ... t))` constraints that exclude `t` being equal to certain sums of prefixes of input variables and individual input variables.\n\nThe sums are constructed as follows:\n\n- For each `i` from 0 to N-1:\n  - Build the prefix sum: sum_{k=0..i} in_k\n  - Assert `(not (= prefix_sum t))`\n\n- Then for all `j` from 1 to N-1:\n  - For each `i` from j to N-1:\n    - Assert `(not (= sum_{k=j..i} in_k t))`\n\n- Also, for each `i` from 0 to N-1:\n  `(not (= in{i} t))`\n\nLooking closely at constraints:\n\n- The sum terms in the first \"block\" start from in0 and increase to in0+in1 ... in0+in1+...+ in{N-1}\n- Then, for the second block for each `j` starting from 1 to N-1, we do sums starting from in_j to sums covering all consecutive variables from in_j up to in_{N-1}.\n\nSo for N=11:\n\n- Declare range constraints for in0..in10 and t.\n- Add (not (= prefix_sum t)) for prefix sums from in0 up to sum of in0..in10\n- Add (not (= sum t)) for all sums starting at in1..in10 and ending at in10\n- Add (not (= in{i} t)) for i=0..10\n\nFinal syntax is conjuncted with (and ...), all wrapped in a top-level (assert (and ...)) clause.\n\nTo produce the expression in proper nested canonical SMT-LIB format like the examples, we must replicate the structure:\n\n- The entire expression is one big (assert (and ...))\n\n- Inside (and ...), the variable bounds followed by all the (not (= ... t)) formulas.\n\nAs the examples are deeply nested chains of (and ...), but since the prompt says \"All per-variable constraints must be combined using a top-level (assert (and ...)) clause\" and output must be canonical without extra commentary, we replicate their style.\n\nWe will produce the final fully nested (and ...), combining all constraints in the style:\n\n(assert (and\n  (and (and (and ... ) ... )\n    ( >= in0 -10)\n    ( <= in0 10)\n    ...\n    ( >= in10 -10)\n    ( <= in10 10)\n    ( >= t -100)\n    ( <= t 100)\n    (not (= in0 t))\n    (not (= (+ in1 in0) t))\n    ...\n    (not (= (+ in10 (+ in9 (+ ... in0))) t))\n    (not (= in1 t))\n    (not (= (+ in2 in1) t))\n    ...\n    (not (= (+ in10 (+ in9 ... in1)) t))\n    ...\n    (not (= in10 t))\n  )\n)\n\nTo respect the deep nesting pattern, the number of (and ...) must match the count of constraints minus one, since each (and a b) only takes two arguments. Each new constraint is combined by nesting inside an and.\n\nSo for the variables and for each constraint, we build a nested chain (and constraint1 (and constraint2 (and ... constraintN))).\n\nWe can produce it similarly to the examples, making sure to separate constraints by nesting all together with (and ...)\n\nBelow is the precise SMT-LIB formula for N=11:\n\nNumber of variables: in0 through in10\n\nNumber of bounds constraints:\n\n- For each of 11 input variables: 2 constraints => 22 constraints\n- For t: 2 constraints\n\nTotal bounds constraints: 22 + 2 = 24\n\nNumber of (not (= ... t)) constraints:\n\n- For i in 0..10 prefix sums from in0: 11 constraints\n\n- For each start j in 1..10, for each end i in j..10, the number of constraints is sum_{j=1}^{10} (11 - j) = sum_{j=1}^{10} (11 - j) = ?\n\nCalculate:\n\nj=1: 10\n\nj=2: 9\n\nj=3: 8\n\nj=4:7\n\nj=5:6\n\nj=6:5\n\nj=7:4\n\nj=8:3\n\nj=9:2\n\nj=10:1\n\nSum = 10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1=55\n\n- Additionally, (not (= in{i} t)) for i=0..10: 11 constraints\n\nTotal not-equal constraints = 11 (prefix sums) + 55 (intermediate sums) +11 (single vars) = 77 constraints.\n\nTotal number of constraints = 24 + 77 = 101\n\nSo the (and ...) nesting will be quite deep.\n\nWe will build constraints exactly as per the examples, recursively nesting (and c1 (and c2 (and c3 ...))) ending with the last constraint.\n\nUse of + for sums and in and t consistent as examples.\n\nNow build the SMT-LIB string.\n\n</think>\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and

(not (= in0 1)) (= (mod in0 2) 0)) ...))).\n\nThus, for 16 variables, I will generate the constraints for in0 to in15 in order, and nest ands from left to right.\n\nFinally, the whole expression begins with (assert (and ...)).\n\nLet's write the expression fully.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (not (= in0 1)) (= (mod in0 2) 0)) (not (= (div in0 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in0 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in0 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in1 1)) (= (mod in1 2) 0)) (not (= (div in1 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in1 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in1 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in2 1)) (= (mod in2 2) 0)) (not (= (div in2 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in2 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in2 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in3 1)) (= (mod in3 2) 0)) (not (= (div in3 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in3 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in3 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in4 1)) (= (mod in4 2) 0)) (not (= (div in4 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in4 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in4 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in5 1)) (= (mod in5 2) 0)) (not (= (div in5 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in5 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in5 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in6 1)) (= (mod in6 2) 0)) (not (= (div in6 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in6 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in6 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in7 1)) (= (mod in7 2) 0)) (not (= (div in7 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in7 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in7 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in8 1)) (= (mod in8 2) 0)) (not (= (div in8 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in8 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in8 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in9 1)) (= (mod in9 2) 0)) (not (= (div in9 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in9 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in9 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in10 1)) (= (mod in10 2) 0)) (not (= (div in10 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in10 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in10 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in11 1)) (= (mod in11 2) 0)) (not (= (div in11 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in11 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in11 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in12 1)) (= (mod in12 2) 0)) (not (= (div in12 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in12 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in12 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in13 1)) (= (mod in13 2) 0)) (not (= (div in13 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in13 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in13 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in14 1)) (= (mod in14 2) 0)) (not (= (div in14 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in14 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in14 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in15 1)) (= (mod in15 2) 0)) (not (= (div in15 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in15 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in15 2) 2) 1)))))\n</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2140, "completion_tokens": 2067, "total_tokens": 4207, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_79b79be41f"}}, "error": null}

For each internal node, it requires that all elements in the left subtree are <= all elements in the right subtree.\n\nTo construct constraints for N=26, which is not given, we proceed similarly:\n\n1) Split 0..25 into two groups:\n- Left group: indices [0..12] (13 elements)\n- Right group: indices [13..25] (13 elements)\n\n2) Apply constraints recursively on left group (N=13) and right group (N=13).\n\nSince there is no example for N=13 directly, use the approach from previous examples:\n\n- For N=13, which is close to N=14 (example given), look at the patterns for constraints for N=14 and N=25, adapt accordingly.\n\nFrom N=25 example:\nThe segments: [0..6], [7..12], [13..18], [19..24] correspond to roughly 5-element groups.\n\nWe can generalize the process:\n\nGeneral approach for constraints:\n\n- For each group (of size n), further split recursively into two subgroups roughly n/2 each.\n\n- For each subgroup, add the following constraints:\n\n  * order pairs inside first group (<= inX inY where X<Y in group)\n  * order pairs inside second group (<= inX inY where X<Y)\n  * (<= smallest in first group, smallest in second group)\n  * (<= all elements in first group, all elements in second group)\n\nThis is visible in the examples where elements in the first half are less or equal to all in the second half, plus recursive constraints within each half.\n\nFor N=26:\n\n- Split into [0..12] and [13..25]\n\nFor left group (0..12):\n\n- N=13 (odd number)\n\nSplit into [0..6] and [7..12]:\n\nLeft: 0..6 (7 elements)\n\nRight: 7..12 (6 elements)\n\nFor left group 0..6 (7 elements):\n\nSplit into [0..3], [4..6]:\n\nLeft: 0..3 (4 elements)\n\nRight: 4..6 (3 elements)\n\nFor 0..3 (4 elements):\n\nsplit into [0..1],[2..3]:\n\nLeft: 0..1 (2 elements), Right: 2..3 (2 elements)\n\nSimilarly for 7..12 (6 elements):\n\nsplit into [7..9],[10..12]:\n\nLeft: 7..9 (3 elements), Right: 10..12 (3 elements)\n\nSimilarly for right group (13..25; 13 elements):\n\nSplit into [13..18], [19..25]:\n\nLeft: 13..18 (6 elements)\n\nRight: 19..25 (7 elements)\n\nThis recursive approach matches what is in examples for N=25 and others.\n\nWe need to write the constraints accordingly.\n\nLet's write the constraints for top-level:\n\n- (<= in0 in13), (<= in1 in13), ..., (<= in12 in13) -- all elements in left group <= in13 (smallest in right group)\n\nSimilarly for recursively inside groups:\n\nLeft group [0..12]:\n\n- constraints between groups [0..6] and [7..12]:\n\n(<= in0 in7), (<= in1 in7),..., (<= in6 in7)\n\nInside [0..6]:\n\n- between [0..3] and [4..6]:\n\n(<= in0 in4), (<= in1 in4), (<= in2 in4), (<= in3 in4)\n\netc.\n\nAnd so on until singletons.\n\nAlso, internal ordering:\n\nFor example, in [0..1]:\n\n(<= in0 in1)\n\nIn [2..3]:\n\n(<= in2 in3)\n\nSimilarly in other parts.\n\nNote that the examples use the pattern of ordering within subgroups and ordering between subtrees.\n\nLet\u2019s now write the pairs explicitly for N=26.\n\n**Step-by-step detailed constraints listing:**\n\n---\n\n**Top split:**  \nLeft: 0..12  \nRight: 13..25\n\nConstraints:  \n- (<= in0 in1)  \n- (<= in2 in3)  \n- (<= in0 in2)  \n- (<= in1

(<= in5 in7)  \n- (<= in6 in7)\n\n- (<= in13 in14)  \n- (<= in13 in15)  \n- (<= in14 in15)\n\n- (<= in16 in17)  \n- (<= in16 in18)  \n- (<= in17 in18)\n\n- (<= in19 in20)  \n- (<= in19 in21)  \n- (<= in20 in21)\n\n- (<= in22 in23)  \n- (<= in22 in24)  \n- (<= in23 in24)\n\n- (<= in19 in22)  \n- (<= in20 in22)  \n- (<= in21 in22)\n\n- (<= in13 in19)  \n- (<= in14 in19)  \n- (<= in15 in19)  \n- (<= in16 in19)  \n- (<= in17 in19)  \n- (<= in18 in19)\n\n- (<= in0 in13)  \n- (<= in1 in13)  \n- (<= in2 in13)  \n- (<= in3 in13)  \n- (<= in4 in13)  \n- (<= in5 in13)  \n- (<= in6 in13)  \n- (<= in7 in13)  \n- (<= in8 in13)  \n- (<= in9 in13)  \n- (<= in10 in13)  \n- (<= in11 in13)  \n- (<= in12 in13)\n\n---\n\nThese pairs come from the pattern seen in N=25, but extended with indexing up to in25:\n\nSimilarly, the right subtree 13..25 is split further:\n\nLeft: 13..18  \nRight: 19..25\n\nInside 13..18:\n\nSplit into [13..15] and [16..18]:\n\nInside [13..15]:\n\n(<= in13 in14), (<= in13 in15), (<= in14 in15)\n\nInside [16..18]:\n\n(<= in16 in17), (<= in16 in18), (<= in17 in18)\n\nBetween [13..15] and [16..18]:\n\n(<= in13 in16), (<= in14 in16), (<= in15 in16), (<= in13 in17), ..., etc.\n\nSimilarly, inside 19..25:\n\nSplit into [19..21], [22..25]\n\nInside [19..21]:\n\n(<= in19 in20), (<= in19 in21), (<= in20 in21)\n\nInside [22..25]:\n\n(<= in22 in23), (<= in22 in24), (<= in23 in24)\n\nBetween [19..21] and [22..25]:\n\n(<= in19 in22), (<= in20 in22), (<= in21 in22)\n\nFinally, the top-level between 13 (start of right group) and left group (0..12):\n\n(<= in0 in13), ..., (<= in12 in13)\n\n---\n\nBased on previous examples, the pattern for constraints within a block of indices follows:\n\n1) Constraints for pairs inside the first half (<= elements increasing)\n\n2) Constraints for pairs inside the second half (<= elements increasing)\n\n3) Constraints for elements of first half <= first element of second half\n\n4) Individual constraints for elements of first half <= elements of second half (usually the first)\n\n---\n\nThis is essentially the merge constraints recursively applied.\n\nBased on all this, I'll write the SMT-LIB assert with (and ...) grouping all constraints.\n\nNote: The challenge is expressing it concisely but precisely according to the problem\u2019s previous formatting.\n\nGiven the constraints, I'll write all in one (assert (and ...)) clause with constraints sorted ascending by indices.\n\n---\n\n</think>\n<answer>(assert (and  (<= in0 in1)  (<= in2 in3)  (<= in0 in2)  (<= in1 in2)  (<= in4 in5)  (<= in4 in6)  (<= in5 in6)  (<= in0

(and ( > in0 in1) ( > in0 in2)) ( > in0 in3)) ... ( > in0 in21)) (and ( > in1 in2) ... ( > in1 in21)) ...)` structure.\n\nTherefore, recreate the pattern for N=22.\n\nDue to length, this will be a very long expression with nested (and (and ...)) structures for all inequalities ( > in i j ) with i<j for i in [0..20], j in [i+1..21].\n\nThis is consistent with examples.\n\nHence, final answer is a single `(assert (and ...))` where inside is nested many ands wrapping the chain of

maintain that style.\n\nNo newline or extra commentary inside, just the whole statement in one line.\n\nLet's generate the constraints:\n\nFor i in 1 to 18:\n  for j in 0 to i-1:\n    add ( >= in{i}

Following the style strictly:\n\n- a double space before each constraint (as per examples)\n\n- each constraint is either `(not ( = inX value))` or `(=  inX value)`\n\nNote that in the examples spacing between `=` and the value is one space; also they use `( =  inX val)` where two spaces after `=` and one before `inX`.

(and (and ( < ch29 97) (>= ch29 65)) (<= ch29 90)) ... )))\n\nBecause they nest left to right, the first argument is the triplet for ch0, the second argument is the (and ...) of the rest.\n\nConstructing this nested pattern:\n\nStarting from i=0:\n(and (and ( < ch0 97) (>= ch0 65)) (<= ch0 90)) = triplet0\n\nThen for i=1 to 29:\n(and triplet_i nested_rest)\n\nAt the end when i=29, nested_rest is just triplet29.\n\nSo the structure is like:\n\n(assert (and triplet0 (and triplet1 (and triplet2 ...

The examples always wrap everything into a single `(assert (and ...))`.\n\nFor example:\n\n- For `in0` (0 mod 3 = 0): constraints `(not (= in0 65))`, `(= in0 66)`\n- For `in1` (1 mod 3 = 1): constraints `(not (= in1 69))`, `(= in1 70)`\n- For `in2` (2 mod 3 = 2): constraints `(not (= in2 73))`, `(not (= in2 74))`\n- Then `in3` repeats the first pattern (mod 3 = 0), and so on.\n\nGiven N=19 example, next steps:\n\n- For N=19, variables 0 through 18 are constrained correctly by the pattern.\n\nWe want N=21, so we need constraints for `in19` and `in20` appended after those for `in0` through `in18`.\n\nCalculate mods for `in19` and `in20`:\n\n- 19 mod 3 = 1 \u2192 `(not (= in19 69))`, `(= in19 70)`\n- 20 mod 3 = 2 \u2192 `(not (= in20 73))`, `(not (= in20 74))`\n\nThese are the constraints to append after the 19 previous variable constraints.\n\nThe large nested `(and ...)` structure is very deep, but the output demands exact canonical SMT-LIB with all constraints combined at top level with a single `(assert (and ...))` and no commentary.\n\nHence I will produce the fully nested `(and ...)` with all constraints from `in0` to `in20`.\n\nThere are 21 variables, each having 2 constraints, so total 42 constraints to combine with nested `(and ...)`.\n\nThe pattern is that each combined `(and A B)` nests the next pair on the right.\n\nI will build this stepwise.\n\nI will write each variable's constraints as:\n\n- If i mod 3 = 0: `(and (not (= in_i 65)) (= in_i 66))`\n- If i mod 3 = 1: `(and (not (= in_i 69)) (= in_i 70))`\n- If i mod 3 = 2: `(and (not (= in_i 73)) (not (= in_i 74)))`\n\nThen combine from i=0 to i=20 as nested `(and ...)`\n\nThis matches the canonical format in examples.\n\nNow proceed to build the final string.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (not ( = in0 65))  ( =  in0 66)) (not ( = in1 69)))  ( =  in1 70)) (not ( = in2 73))) (not ( = in2 74))) (not ( = in3 65)))  ( =  in3 66)) (not ( = in4 69)))  ( =  in4 70)) (not ( = in5 73))) (not ( = in5 74))) (not ( = in6 65)))  ( =  in6 66)) (not ( = in7 69)))  ( =  in7 70)) (not ( = in8 73))) (not ( = in8 74))) (not ( = in9 65)))  ( =  in9 66)) (not ( = in10 69)))  ( =  in10 70)) (not ( = in11 73))) (not ( = in11 74))) (not ( = in12 65)))  ( =  in12 66)) (not ( = in13 69)))  ( =  in13 70)) (not ( = in14 73))) (not ( = in14 74))) (not ( = in15 65)))  ( =  in15 66)) (not ( = in16 69)))  ( =  in16 70)) (not ( = in17 73))) (not ( = in17 74))) (not ( = in18 65)))  ( =  in18 66)) (not ( = in19 69)))  ( =  in19 70)) (not ( = in20 73))) (not ( = in20 74)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2428, "completion_tokens": 1162, "total_tokens": 3590, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

(and  ( <=  in1 in0)  ( <  in1 in0)) ...)))\n\nwith one (and) per nested pair, each wrapping previous.\n\nWe create 18 nested (and)s.\n\nLet's count nesting for N=5:\n\nSample N=5 has:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  ( <=  in1 in0)  ( <  in1 in0)) ...(up to in4 in3)))\n\nThis is 7 nested (and)s for 4 constraints (which is 4 pairs).\n\nBut the total (and)s = 2*(N-1)-1\n\nFor N=5, 2*(5-1)-1=7.

( < ...)))))\n\nSo, a more consistent way is:\n\n- For i in 1..N-1\n\n   group_i = (and ( <= in_i in_{i-1} ) ( < in_i in_{i-1} ))\n\n- Then we nest (and prev group_i), starting at i=1 with group_1\n\nSo for i=1:\n\n nested = group_1\n\nFor i=2..N-1:\n\n nested = (and nested group_i)\n\nFinally:\n\n(assert nested)\n\nThis leads to left nested (and)s.\n\nNow the problem is the examples have many many nested (and). For e.g., in N=3 example:\n\n(assert (and (and (and  ( <=  in1 in0)  ( <  in1 in0))  ( <=  in2 in1))  ( <  in2 in1)))\n\nThis is asymmetric.\n\nAnother example:\n\nN=12:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and...

( <=  in11 in10))  ( <  in11 in10)))\n\nAgain, asymmetric nesting.\n\nHence we produce exactly the large nested ands we see in N=14 and N=15 examples.\n\nTherefore, the requested output for N=19 is:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  ( <=  in1 in0)  ( <  in1 in0))  ( <=  in2 in1))  ( <  in2 in1))  ( <=  in3 in2))  ( <  in3 in2))  ( <=  in4 in3))  ( <  in4 in3))  ( <=  in5 in4))  ( <  in5 in4))  ( <=  in6 in5))  ( <  in6 in5))  ( <=  in7 in6))  ( <  in7 in6))  ( <=  in8 in7))  ( <  in8 in7))  ( <=  in9 in8))  ( <  in9 in8))  ( <=  in10 in9))  ( <  in10 in9))  ( <=  in11 in10))  ( <  in11 in10))  ( <=  in12 in11))  ( <  in12 in11))  ( <=  in13 in12))  ( <  in13 in12))  ( <=  in14 in13))  ( <  in14 in13))  ( <=  in15 in14))  ( <  in15 in14))  ( <=  in16 in15))  ( <  in16 in15))  ( <=  in17 in16))  ( <  in17 in16))  ( <=  in18 in17))  ( <  in18 in17)))\n\nThis matches the pattern.\n\nNote: There is a space between each token and no newlines.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  ( <=  in1 in0)  ( <  in1 in0))  ( <=  in2 in1))  ( <  in2 in1))  ( <=  in3 in2))  ( <  in3 in2))  ( <=  in4 in3))  ( <  in4 in3))  ( <=  in5 in4))  ( <  in5 in4))  ( <=  in6 in5))  ( <  in6 in5))  ( <=  in7 in6))  ( <  in7 in6))  ( <=  in8 in7))  ( <  in8 in7))  ( <=  in9 in8))  ( <  in9 in8))  ( <=  in10 in9))  ( <  in10 in9))  ( <=  in11 in10))  ( <  in11 in10))  ( <=  in12 in11))  ( <  in12 in11))  ( <=  in13 in12))  ( <  in13 in12))  ( <=  in14 in13))  ( <  in14 in13))  ( <=  in15 in14))  ( <  in15 in14))  ( <=  in16 in15))  ( <  in16 in15))  ( <=  in17 in16))  ( <  in17 in16))  ( <=  in18 in17))  ( <  in18 in17)))\n</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1184, "completion_tokens": 3503, "total_tokens": 4687, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

The constraints are inequalities of the form `(<= inX inY)` - these represent ordering constraints between elements.\n2. The variables are split into segments that are recursively merged:\n   - For example, for small N like 8, the constraints follow patterns looking like merges of pairs of elements `(in0 in1)`, `(in2 in3)`, then merges of those pairs, continuing up to the full range.\n3. The pattern strongly suggests an encoding of a merge sort or binary merge tree ordering constraints.\n\nBreakdown from the given constraints:\n\n- At each \"merge\" level, pairs or groups of elements are compared to ensure the correct sorted order:\n\nFor example, N=8 constraints snippet:\n```\n( <=  in0 in1)\n( <=  in2 in3)\n( <=  in0 in2)\n( <=  in1 in2)\n( <=  in4 in5)\n( <=  in6 in7)\n( <=  in4 in6)\n( <=  in5 in6)\n( <=  in0 in4)\n( <=  in1 in4)\n( <=  in2 in4)\n( <=  in3 in4)\n```\nWe can see merges on segments `[0..1]`, `[2..3]`, merges `[0..3]`, `[4..5]`, `[6..7]`, merges `[4..7]`, and finally merge `[0..7]`.\n\nSimilarly for N=9:\n- Split into `[0..2]`, `[3..4]`, `[5..7]`, with further merges.\n\nFor N=13:\n- Merges involve `[0..3]`, `[4..6]`, `[7..9]`, `[10..12]`, with merges at each level.\n\nFor N=15:\n- Merger on `[0..3]`, `[4..7]`, `[8..11]`, `[12..14]` and so on.\n\nThis suggests the input is segmented into parts whose sizes are powers of two or close to powers of two, and then these segments are merged in binary tree fashion.\n\n**Determining the pattern for N=17:**\n\nWe will try to break N=17 into segments similarly.\n\n- N=17 can be split into:\n\n  - First 8 elements: `in0..in7` (similar to N=8 segment)\n  - Next 8 elements: `in8..in15` (also like N=8 segment)\n  - One remaining element: `in16`\n\nThen merge those three parts:\n\n- First merge:\n  - merge of `in0..7` (size 8)\n- Second merge:\n  - merge of `in8..15` (size 8)\n- Finally merge `in0..7`, `in8..15`, and `in16`\n\nFrom given constraints, merging seems pairwise, so let's think about how `in16` is included.\n\nFollowing the pattern of N=9 where one leftover is merged similarly to the others, or more generally, compare the last element with all from the merged segments below.\n\nHence, the top-level merges for N=17:\n\n- merge `in0..7`\n- merge `in8..15`\n- merge `in16` with `in8..15` (like a singleton merged with the 8-segment)\n- finally, merge `in0..7` with the merged result of `in8..16`\n\nThis gives us the structure of merges.\n\n**Next step:** Enumerate the `(<= inX inY)` constraints in the pattern used.\n\nLooking at the example constraints, the pattern inside each segment is:\n\n- ( <= in0 in1) and ( <= in2 in3) (lower-level merges inside a segment)\n- ( <= in0 in2) and ( <= in1 in2) (merging pairs)\n- For the next segments similarly.\n\nAlso, the final merges impose constraints that all elements of the first segment are less or equal to elements of the next segment.\n\n**Stepwise construction:**\n\n1. Merge `in0..7` (N=8 constraints for `in0..7`):\n\nCopy constraint structure for N=8 but indices shifted properly (starting at in0):\n\n```\n( <=  in0 in1)  ( <=  in2 in3))  \n( <=  in0 in2)  \n( <=  in1 in2)  \n( <=  in4 in5)  \n( <=  in6 in7)  \n( <=  in4 in6)  \n( <=  in5 in6)  \n( <=  in0 in4)  \n( <=  in1 in4)  \n( <=  in2 in4)  \n( <=  in3 in4)\n```\n\n2. Merge `in8..15` (N=8 constraints similarly shifted by +8):\n\n```\n( <=  in8 in9)  ( <=  in10 in11))  \n( <=  in8 in10)  \n( <=  in9 in10)  \n( <=  in12 in13)  \n( <=  in14 in15)  \n( <=  in12 in14)  \n( <=  in13 in14)  \n( <=  in8 in12)  \n( <=  in9 in12)  \n( <=  in10 in12)  \n( <=  in11 in12)\n```\n\n3. Merge `in8..15` with `in16`\n\nUsing the pattern from N=9 or N=13 when there's an extra element merged:\n\n- For example in N=9, the single element `in4` was merged with the earlier group `in0..3`:\n\nWe add `( <= in8 in16)` ... so using the pattern for merging (<= ai bi) for all i in the smaller merged part.\n\nIn N=9, we had constraints `( <= in0 in5)`, `( <= in1 in5)`, `( <= in2 in5)`, `( <= in3 in5)`, `( <= in4 in5)` where `in5` was last element of the next segment.\n\nSimilarly, here, to merge `in8..15` (8 elements) with `in16` (1 element), create constraints:\n\n```\n( <= in8 in16)\n( <= in9 in16)\n( <= in10 in16)\n( <= in11 in16)\n( <= in12 in16)\n( <= in13 in16)\n( <= in14 in16)\n( <= in15 in16)\n```\n\n4. Finally merge `in0..7` with the whole `in8..16` segment.\n\nFrom the examples, to merge two sequences A=[a0..aK] and B=[b0..bM], constraints are:\n\n- For each ai in A and each bj in B, constraints to ensure ai <= bj via minimal necessary inequalities.\n\nBut from given examples, it's an iterative scheme where:\n\n- The merged segments themselves have constraints.\n\n- Then the last merge is from left segment to the next merged segment, so constraints:\n\n```\n( <= in0 in8)\n( <= in1 in8)\n( <= in2 in8)\n( <= in3 in8)\n( <= in4 in8)\n( <= in5 in8)\n( <= in6 in8)\n( <= in7 in8)\n```\n\nWhy only these? Because in examples N=15:\n\nFor last merges `( <= in0 in8)` ... `( <= in7 in8)`\n\nThat is consistent with the highest-level merge constraints.\n\nThe rest, the ordering inside the right segment, ensures `in8..16` are already sorted.\n\nThus, assemble all constraints:\n\n- The merges inside `in0..7` (N=8 fixed constraints)\n- The merges inside `in8..15` (N=8 fixed constraints)\n- Merging `in8..15` and `in16` (constraints above)\n- Merging `in0..7` and `in8..16` (constraints above)\n\nThe total is all of these combined by a single `(assert (and ...))`.\n\n**Step to write final SMT-LIB constraint string:**\n\nAdd all constraints with `(<= inX inY)` accordingly.\n\n**Count of constraints (sanity check):**\n\n- In each N=8 segment, number of constraints is 11 from given example.\n\n- For 2 segments: 11 + 11 = 22\n\n- Merging `in8..15` and `in16` adds 8 constraints\n\n- Merging `in0..7` and `in8..16` adds 8 constraints\n\nTotal constraints: 22 + 8 + 8 = 38 constraints.\n\n**Now list all constraints in SMT-LIB format with `(<= ...)`:**\n\n---\n\n**Final verification**: The given examples also sometimes put multiple constraints inside nested `(and (and ...))`, but the question instructs to combine all constraints directly into a single top-level `(assert (and ...))`.\n\n---\n\n<think> Proceed to write the full SMT-LIB top-level assert with all constraints for N=17. </think>\n\n<answer>\n(assert (and \n  (<= in0 in1) (<= in2 in3) (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2) (<= in4 in5) (<= in6 in7) (<= in4 in6) (<= in5 in6) (<= in0 in4) (<= in1 in4) (<= in2 in4) (<= in3 in4)\n  (<= in8 in9) (<= in10 in11) (<= in8 in10) (<= in9 in10) (<= in12 in13) (<= in14 in15) (<= in12 in14) (<= in13 in14) (<= in8 in12) (<= in9 in12) (<= in10 in12) (<= in11 in12)\n  (<= in8 in16) (<= in9 in16) (<= in10 in16) (<= in11 in16) (<= in12 in16) (<= in13 in16) (<= in14 in16) (<= in15 in16)\n  (<= in0 in8) (<= in1 in8) (<= in2 in8) (<= in3 in8) (<= in4 in8) (<= in5 in8) (<= in6 in8) (<= in7 in8)\n))\n</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1088, "completion_tokens": 2223, "total_tokens": 3311, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

The top-level is (assert (and ...all variables constraints...)).\n\nFor N=25, we need to replicate these constraints for in0 through in24, combined with (and ...), and wrap in (assert ...).\n\nAlso, the output should be in exact canonical SMT-LIB format as shown.\n\nFormatting note: Notice in the examples that the constraints are nested deeply, e.g.:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (... var0 ...) (var1 ...)) (var2 ...)) ... ))\n\nBecause each \"and\" combines exactly two predicates, the result is a binary nested chain of (and ...).\n\nSo, for 25 variables \u00d7 5 constraints each = 125 constraints to combine with nested (and ...).\n\nWe will generate, per variable in_i:\n\n(and \n  (not (= in_i 1))\n  (= (mod in_i 2) 0)\n  (not (= (div in_i 2) 1))\n  (= (mod (div in_i 2) 2) 0)\n  (not (= (div (div in_i 2) 2) 1))\n)\n\nBut since the examples put the per-variable constraint inside one (and ...), and then combine all variables constraints using nested (and ...), we must replicate the same nesting pattern.\n\nNote: The example directly writes all constraints in a flattened (and ...). But in the N=18 and N=24 examples, the entire structure is nested as a long chain of (and (and (...)(...))(...)).\n\nTo match canonical form, we'll follow the pattern of nested binary ands, starting from the first two variable constraints combined with (and ...), then combined with the third, etc.\n\nFirst, define the per-variable constraint string for variable i:\n\n(and\n  (not (= in{i} 1))\n  (= (mod in{i} 2) 0)\n  (not (= (div in{i} 2) 1))\n  (= (mod (div in{i} 2) 2) 0)\n  (not (= (div (div in{i} 2) 2) 1))\n)\n\nThis is a four-constraint conjunction of:\n1. (not (= in{i} 1))\n2. (= (mod in{i} 2) 0)\n3. (not (= (div in{i} 2) 1))\n4. (= (mod (div in{i} 2) 2) 0)\n5. (not (= (div (div in{i} 2) 2) 1))\n\nBut the example lumps these all together as a single (and ...) expression per variable, then all variables combined in nested (and ...).\n\nWe will write a helper function to create the nested (and ...) for each per-variable constraints, then combine all variables constraints similarly.\n\nSo the approach:\n\n- For each variable i in 0..24:\n\n  define C_i as \n\n  (and \n    (not (= in{i} 1)) \n    (= (mod in{i} 2) 0) \n    (not (= (div in{i} 2) 1)) \n    (= (mod (div in{i} 2) 2) 0)\n    (not (= (div (div in{i} 2) 2) 1))\n  )\n\nThen generate the nested (and ...) combining C_i for i=0..24.\n\nThe top level: (assert (and ... ))\n\nWe must express nested binary ands:\n\nand_n([x1,x2,x3,...,xn]) = (and x1 (and x2 (and x3 (... (and x_{n-1} x_n)...)))\n\nWe can build from right to left or left to right consistently.\n\nI will build from left to right:\n\nand_n = (and C_0 (and C_1 (and C_2 (... (and C_{23} C_{24})...)))\n\nWe will generate this exact nesting in the output.\n\nLet's prepare the per-variable string exactly as in example (using spaces for indentation as in the sample):\n\nPer variable:\n\n(and (not (= in{i} 1)) (= (mod in{i} 2) 0) (not (= (div in{i} 2) 1)) (= (mod (div in{i} 2) 2) 0) (not (= (div (div in{i} 2) 2) 1)))\n\nNow combining with nested (and ...).\n\nFor better clarity, from the sample, the nesting is done via chaining (and (and ...)(...)).\n\nE.g. for N=1, just one per-variable constraint inside (assert (and ...)).\n\nFor N>1, nested.\n\nSo finally, the output string is:\n\n(assert (and C_0 (and C_1 (and C_2 ...

The examples show that the nested (and ... ) clauses are accumulated from left to right, but the final format is just deeply nested (and ... ). For the purpose of the output, we replicate the exact style used in examples.\n\nThe number of inequalities is C(N, 2) = N*(N-1)/2.\n\nFor N=16: variables are in0 to in15, and inequalities:\n(> in0 in1), (> in0 in2), ..., (> in0 in15),\n(> in1 in2), (> in1 in3), ..., (> in1 in15),\n...\n(> in14 in15)\n\nWe need to build the nested (and ...) clauses exactly as in examples, with the same nested structure. From the given examples, the nesting consists of:\n\n(assert (and (and (and ... (and ( > in0 in1) ( > in0 in2) ) ( > in0 in3) ) ... ) ( > in14 in15) ))\n\nThe number of nested (and ... ) is equal to the number of inequalities minus 1, and every two inequalities are combined with an (and ...).\n\nBut for the output, since the user only wants the exact SMT-LIB string, not the intermediate steps, and the examples show that the nesting is a single long chain of nested (and ... ) of pairs (balanced actually is left-associative nesting).\n\nWe will write a function to construct this nesting for all inequalities for N=16.\n\nSpecifically, for 16:\n\nIndices: 0..15\n\nPairs: for i in [0..14], for j in [i+1..15], list all pairs.\n\nNumber of pairs: 16*15/2 = 120 inequalities\n\nThe nesting:\n\n(and (and (and (and ...

(and inequality1 inequality2) inequality3) ... ) inequality_last)\n\nWe put inequalities in order of pairs as per examples:\n\nFirst inequalities:\n\n( > in0 in1) ( > in0 in2)\n\nnested with (and ( > in0 in1) ( > in0 in2))\n\nthen nested to include ( > in0 in3), etc.\n\nFor the sake of correctness, following the examples format, the nesting is constructed by repeatedly nesting (and (and (...)) <next_inequality>).\n\nTherefore, code-wise, build nested from left to right:\n\nstart nest = (and ( > in0 in1) ( > in0 in2))\n\nnest = (and nest ( > in0 in3))\n\nnest = (and nest ( > in0 in4))\n\n...\n\nuntil all inequalities are included.\n\nAt the end, wrap with (assert nest)\n\nDue to the huge size of the expression, we produce as per examples but no extra commentary or newlines, just one single line.\n\nHence, the final SMT-LIB constraint string for N=16 is:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and ...

For N=4, there are 9 such `( > ...)` constraints starting with `(> in 1)`.\n   For N=8, there are also 9 such constraints (actually it looks the same as N=4 but repeated).\n   \n   But for N=9, N=10, N=11, it\u2019s the same pattern and count of nested `(> ...)` terms.\n\n   Actually, from each example, the number of `( > ...)` clauses following `(<= in 10)` seems constant at 9.\n\n4.

The nested expression always reduces by wrapping one more `(- ... 1)` around the previous one.\n\n6. Despite the N changing, the constraints only mention `in 0` and `in 1` with nested subtractions on `in 1`.\n\nGiven that the problem statement shows these snippets for N=4 up to N=11 with the same pattern, the constraint for N=12 will follow the identical pattern, i.e., the same 2 base inequalities on `in 0` and the same 9 nested `(> ...)` constraints on `in 1`.\n\nGiven the examples, the SMT-LIB constraint string is as follows for N=12:\n\n(assert (and \n    (>= in 0) \n    (<= in 10) \n    (> in 1) \n    (> (- in 1) 1) \n    (> (- (- in 1) 1) 1) \n    (> (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) \n    (> (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) \n    (> (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) \n    (> (- (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)\n    (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) \n    (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)\n))\n\nThe outermost `(assert (and ...))` combines all constraints.\n\nAlso, from the examples, the constraints are nested with multiple `(and ...)` forms, each nesting two constraints to combine them, forming a left-heavy binary tree of `and`.\n\nWe need to replicate the exact nesting style where there is a binary tree of `(and)` pairs.\n\nExample for N=4:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and <c1> <c2>) <c3>) ...) <c10>)))\n\nThere are 10 constraints total inside: 2 base on `in 0`, and 8 nested on `in 1`.

( > in0 in1) ( > in0 in2) ... ( > in21 in22) ( > in22 in23)))\n\nFor N=24, we add pairs involving in23:\n- All pairs (in_i, in_j) for i<j with j up to 23, so extending the pairs to include (in0 in23), (in1 in23), ..., (in22 in23)\n\nThe actual constraint string must use the nested (and ...) style as shown, but the exact nested structure is very deep and basically consists of many nested (and (and ...)) with one comparison in each leaf.\n\nThe final form will look exactly like the precedent with one extra variable, with all pairs asserted that the earlier variable is greater than the later variable.\n\nSince the task is to output the exact canonical SMT-LIB formatted string with the entire conjunction nested in one top-level assert (and ...), I will follow the lead from the sample outputs \u2014 with deeply nested (and ...).\n\nHowever, to output the canonical SMT-LIB format exactly, I don't need to replicate the \"and\" blocks the way it was shown with excessive nesting, because that is presumably the canonical output. The examples contradict each other in style vs. readability, but given the examples, we must follow that repeated multiple nested `(and (and ... ))` pattern with each extra assertion enclosed in an extra (and ...). So for each added constraint, nest inside (and ... constraints).\n\nGiven this is a very large nested structure, I will generate it programmatically.\n\nThe strategy:\n- For each pair (i,j), create the clause ( > in{i} in{j})\n- Starting from the last pair, nest them inside (and clause)\n- Each new clause is nested inside an (and previous_new_clause new_clause).\n\nTotal pairs for N=24: C(24,2) = 24*23/2 = 276 pairs.\n\nExamples show the nesting is (assert (and (and (and ... ( > in0 in1) ( > in0 in2)) ( > in0 in3)) ... ))\n\nSo the deepest nesting is with many nested ands, each joining the previous nested and with the next atomic clause.\n\nSo it looks like:\n\n(assert (and \n  (and \n    (and ... \n      ( > in0 in1)  ( > in0 in2)\n    ) \n    ( > in0 in3)\n  )\n  ...\n))\n\nBecause the examples do not have a flat list of constraints but nest each constraint pair one by one inside an (and), I will replicate the style accordingly.\n\nNote: This approach for 276 pairs will be very large, but following the exact pattern.\n\nI will implement as follows (pseudocode):\n\nstart = \"(assert (and \"\nfor all pairs except last:\n  start = \"(and \" + start + \" ( > in{i} in{j}))\"\nfinal = start + \"))\"\n\nBut careful: the first clause added should start the innermost (and ( > ... ) ( > ... )), so the initial step as in example N=13 or N=23 pair count is that multiple pairs are grouped inside an (and (and ...)) style.\n\nFrom the example:\n\n- When more than 2 assertions, they group the first two in (and ( > in0 in1) ( > in0 in2)) and then nest further ands with the next clause.\n\nGiven the complexity and the examples, the simplest is to make each constraint nested with a new (and ... previous_constraint current_constraint).\n\nThe first two constraints make (and ( > in0 in1) ( > in0 in2)).\n\nThen add ( > in0 in3) makes (and (and ( > in0 in1) ( > in0 in2)) ( > in0 in3)), etc.\n\nI'll implement this nesting exactly.\n\nStep 1: list all pairs (i,j) with i<j in lex order.\n\nStep 2: build nested and statements accordingly:\n- For first two pairs: result = (and ( > in0 in1) ( > in0 in2))\n- For each next pair: result = (and result ( > in{i} in{j}))\n\nFinally wrap with (assert result)\n\nI will now write the final SMT-LIB constraint

Now nest them all inside a nested chain of (and ...) as in the examples: starting from last pair, wrap each pair in an and, nesting all together.\n\nNote the examples have the top-level assert (assert (and ...)), and inside the top-level and, they have nested and's chaining the inner expressions.\n\nEach nested and wraps the next nested and plus one pair of constraints.\n\nHence, from the inside out:\n\nWe start from:\n\n(and (<= in27 in26) (< in27 in26))\n\nThen wrap:\n\n(and (<= in26 in25) (< in26 in25) (and (<= in27 in26) (< in27 in26)))\n\nThen wrap:\n\n(and (<= in25 in24) (< in25 in24) (and (<= in26 in25) (< in26 in25) (and ... )))\n\netc., until the outermost and contains all pairs.\n\nSo the nesting depth = number of pairs = 27.\n\nSo final expression is: (assert (and [nested 27 times and wrapping 54 comparisons]))\n\nThat matches the pattern seen in the examples.\n\nHence we will produce:\n\n(assert (and (and (and ...

(and c1 c2) c3) ...) cn)\n\nExample for 3 constraints:\n\n(and (and c1 c2) c3)\n\nFor single constraint just the constraint (no and needed)\n\nWe'll proceed stepwise:\n\nFor each j: nested_and of

No, previous splits always powers of two - splits at 16 or 8\n\n- From pattern N=21 is split into blocks: 0..10 and 11..20 plus one element (20), i.e., 21 elements - so merges are done for unbalanced sizes.\n\nOur N=22 is just N=21+1, so similar.\n\nBased on N=21, extra elements are handled carefully.\n\nSo to reconstruct for N=22:\n\n- First two levels: pairs merged into fours, fours into eights, eights into sixteen\n\n- Last merge: 16 elements and 6 elements\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- block0: 0..15 (16 elems)\n\n- block1: 16..21 (6 elems)\n\nFor block0:\n\n- Pairs (0,1), (2,3), ..., (14,15)\n- Merge pairs into 4s and 8s as in N=16 example for the first 16 elements.\n\nBlock1:\n\n- Pairs (16,17), (18,19), (20,21)\n- Merge (16,17) and (18,19) into 16..19 with constraints similar to N=4\n- Then merge 16..19 with (20,21), similar to N=6 example\n\nFinally, merge block0 and block1 with constraints (<= inX in16) for X in 0..15.\n\nBased on this, and looking carefully at N=16 and N=18 examples:\n\nFor N=16 constraints:\n\n- (<= in0 in1) (<= in2 in3) (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2) (<= in4 in5) (<= in6 in7) (<= in4 in6) (<= in5 in6) (<= in0 in4) (<= in1 in4) (<= in2 in4) (<= in3 in4) \n\n- Repeat for 8..15 block:\n\n(<= in8 in9) (<= in10 in11) (<= in8 in10) (<= in9 in10) (<= in12 in13) (<= in14 in15) (<= in12 in14) (<= in13 in14) (<= in8 in12) (<= in9 in12) (<= in10 in12) (<= in11 in12) \n\n- Merge at higher level:\n\n(<= in0 in8) ... (<= in7 in8)\n\nSimilarly for N=18 and N=21 examples.\n\nThus for N=22 we can extend the same logic.\n\nI will list all inequalities to the best of my understanding, following the pattern.\n\nFirst, pairs at lowest level:\n\n(<= in0 in1) (<= in2 in3) (<= in4 in5) (<= in6 in7) (<= in8 in9) (<= in10 in11) (<= in12 in13) (<= in14 in15) (<= in16 in17) (<= in18 in19) (<= in20 in21)\n\nNext, merge pairs into 4s:\n\nOn 0..3:\n\n(<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2)\n\nOn 4..7:\n\n(<= in4 in6) (<= in5 in6)\n\nOn 8..11:\n\n(<= in8 in10) (<= in9 in10)\n\nOn 12..15:\n\n(<= in12 in14) (<= in13 in14)\n\nOn 16..19:\n\n(<= in16 in18) (<= in17 in18)\n\nOn 20..21: already a pair, no merge\n\nMerge 4s into 8s:\n\nOn 0..7:\n\n(<= in0 in4) (<= in1 in4) (<= in2 in4) (<= in3 in4)\n\nOn 8..15:\n\n(<= in8 in12) (<= in9 in12) (<= in10 in12) (<= in11 in12)\n\nOn 16..21:\n\nTreating 16..19 and 20..21:\n\n(<= in16 in20) (<= in17 in20) (<= in18 in20) (<= in19 in20)\n\nMerge 8s into 16:\n\nOn 0..15:\n\n(<= in0 in8) (<= in1 in8) (<= in2 in8) (<= in3 in8) (<= in4 in8) (<= in5 in8) (<= in6 in8) (<= in7 in8)\n\nFinally merge 16..21:\n\nMerge 0..15 with 16..21:\n\n(<= in0 in16) (<= in1 in16) (<= in2 in16) (<= in3 in16) (<= in4 in16) (<= in5 in16) (<= in6 in16) (<= in7 in16) (<= in8 in16) (<= in9 in16) (<= in10 in16) (<= in11 in16) (<= in12 in16) (<= in13 in16) (<= in14 in16) (<= in15 in16)\n\nExtra intra-block constraints inside blocks for completeness (from previous patterns):\n\nOn 0..3 block: from N=4 example, also (<= in0 in1) included already.\n\nOn 0..5 block, from N=6 example, includes constraints like (<= in3 in4), (<= in3 in5), (<= in4 in5), etc.\n\nSimilarly, for block 0..15, nested constraints for solving sorting within smaller parts like (<= in3 in5), (<= in4 in5) (from N=12 example), should be added.\n\nLooking back at N=12 example:\n\n(<= in3 in5), (<= in4 in5) appear, which are merging indices from 3 up to 5.\n\nTherefore for the block 0..5:\n\nAdd (<= in3 in5) (<= in4 in5)\n\nSimilarly for blocks of sizes larger than 4 but not powers of two.\n\nFor 16..21 block, from N=6 example:\n\n- pairs: (<= in0 in1), (<= in2 in3)\n\n- merges: (<= in0 in2), (<= in1 in2)\n\nEquivalent in indices:\n\n(<= in16 in17), (<= in18 in19), (<= in16 in18), (<= in17 in18)\n\nThen merge of (16..19) and (20..21):\n\n(<= in16 in20), (<= in17 in20), (<= in18 in20), (<= in19 in20)\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow nesting of (and) is a very deep nested left-associative form.\n\nBut the question is: all constraints combined top-level with one assert (and ...)\n\nSo final output would be a single line:\n\n(assert (and ...all (<= ...) clauses ...))\n\nWe will list all constraints replicated from example pattern with correct variables and pairs.\n\nOrder doesn't matter but should be generated similar to above examples.\n\nLet's iterate and list all constraints to be included:\n\n1) Level 1 pairs:\n\n(<= in0 in1)\n\n(<= in2 in3)\n\n(<= in4 in5)\n\n(<= in6 in7)\n\n(<= in8 in9)\n\n(<= in10 in11)\n\n(<= in12 in13)\n\n(<= in14 in15)\n\n(<= in16 in17)\n\n(<= in18 in19)\n\n(<= in20 in21)\n\n2) Level 2 merges of pairs into 4:\n\n(<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2)\n\n(<= in4 in6) (<= in5 in6)\n\n(<= in8 in10) (<= in9 in10)\n\n(<= in12 in14) (<= in13 in14)\n\n(<= in16 in18) (<= in17 in18)\n\n3) Level 3 merges of 4 into 8:\n\n(<= in0 in4) (<= in1 in4) (<= in2 in4) (<= in3 in4)\n\n(<= in8 in12) (<= in9 in12) (<= in10 in12) (<= in11 in12)\n\n(<= in16 in20) (<= in17 in20) (<= in18 in20) (<= in19 in20)\n\n4) Level 4 merges of 8 into 16:\n\n(<= in0 in8) (<= in1 in8) (<= in2 in8) (<= in3 in8) (<= in4 in8) (<= in5 in8) (<= in6 in8) (<= in7 in8)\n\n5) Level 5 merges of 16 into 22 (this last merge):\n\n(<= in0 in16) (<= in1 in16) (<= in2 in16) (<= in3 in16) (<= in4 in16) (<= in5 in16) (<= in6 in16) (<= in7 in16) (<= in8 in16) (<= in9 in16) (<= in10 in16) (<= in11 in16) (<= in12 in16) (<= in in13 16) (<= in14 in16) (<= in15 in16)\n\n6) Additional constraints within blocks:\n\nFrom N=6 example (for block 16..21):\n\n(<= in16 in17)\n\n(<= in18 in19)\n\n(<= in16 in18)\n\n(<= in17 in18)\n\n(<= in20 in21)\n\n(<= in16 in20)\n\n(<= in17 in20)\n\n(<= in18 in20)\n\n(<= in19 in20)\n\nFrom N=12 example, in 0..5 block, (<= in3 in5), (<= in4 in5) are present.\n\nSo for indices 0..5:\n\n(<= in3 in4)\n\n(<= in3 in5)\n\n(<= in4 in5)\n\nAdd these constraints.\n\nSimilarly, for 8..15:\n\n(<= in11 in13)\n\n(<= in11 in14)\n\n(<= in12 in14)\n\n(<= in13 in14)\n\nFrom N=16 example:\n\n(<= in12 in13), (<= in14 in15), (<= in12 in14), (<= in13 in14)\n\nAlso from N=16:\n\n(<= in4 in5), (<= in6 in7), (<= in4 in6), (<= in5 in6)\n\nAttach all these for each block accordingly.\n\nSimilarly for leftmost blocks:\n\n(<= in2 in3)\n\n(<= in0 in1)\n\n(<= in0 in2)\n\n(<= in1 in2)\n\nFinal comprehensive list:\n\n- (<= in0 in1) (<= in2 in3) (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2)\n\n- (<= in3 in4) (<= in3 in5) (<= in4 in5)\n\n- (<= in4 in5) (<= in6 in7) (<= in4 in6) (<= in5 in6)\n\n- (<= in8 in9) (<= in10 in11) (<= in8 in10) (<= in9 in10)\n\n- (<= in12 in13) (<= in14 in15) (<= in12 in14) (<= in13 in14)\n\n- (<= in11 in13) (<= in11 in14) (<= in12 in14) (<= in13 in14)\n\n- (<= in16 in17) (<= in18 in19) (<= in16 in18) (<= in17 in18)\n\n- (<= in20 in21)\n\nPlus previous level constraints merging blocks.\n\nGiven the redundancy, it's best to keep those present in above levels.\n\nThus we will use only constraints proven in previous examples.\n\nSummary final: all constraints of the form (<= inX inY) where X and Y are indices from the described pairs and merges.\n\nNow, the question also shows the nested and's, but the prompt requests all per-variable constraints combined using a top-level (assert (and ...)) clause.\n\nHence we flatten the nested (and)s to a single (and clause1 clause2 ...)\n\nSo final SMT-LIB constraint for N=22 is:\n\n(assert (and ...all constraints described above...))\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and  (<= in0 in1)  (<=

From the examples analyzed:\n   - Variables with indices congruent to 0 mod 4 (in0, in4, in8, etc.) only have `(not (= ... 73))` and `(not (= ... 74))` constraints, i.e., disallow 73 ('I') and 74 ('J').\n   - Variables with indices congruent to 3 mod 4 (in3, in7, in11, in15, in19, in23) have `(not (= ... 65))` and `(= inX 66)` clauses.\n   - Variables with indices congruent to 1 mod 4 (in1, in5, in9, in13, in17, in21) have `(not (= ... 69))` and `(= inX 70)` clauses.\n   - Variables with indices congruent to 2 mod 4 (in2, in6, in10, in14, in18, in22) have `(not (= inX 73))` and `(not (= inX 74))` clauses.\n   - Variables with indices multiple of 4 (i % 4 == 0) other than 0 (like in0, in4, in8, in12, etc.) disallow 73 and 74 only.\n   - The special pattern is:\n     - For even variables not mod 4 == 0 (i.e., 2 and 6 mod 4) both 73 and 74 are disallowed.\n     - For in0, in4, in8 ... (i mod 4 == 0) just disallow 73 and 74.\n     - For variables mod 4 == 3 (3,7,11,15,19,23) disallow 65 and require equal 66.\n     - For variables mod 4 == 1 (1,5,9,13,17,21) disallow 69 and require equal 70.\n     - For variables mod 4 == 2 disallow 73 and 74.\n  \nWait, let's look at the provided examples carefully cycle per variable:\n\nLet's consider `in0`:\n  - (not (= in0 65))\n  - (= in0 66)\n`in1`:\n  - (not (= in1 69))\n  - (= in1 70)\n`in2`:\n  - (not (= in2 73))\n  - (not (= in2 74))\n`in3`:\n  - (not (= in3 65))\n  - (= in3 66)\n\nSequence seems repeated every 4 variables.\n\nSo pattern per variable `i` mod 4:\n- i mod 4 == 0:\n  - (not (= in i 65))\n  - (= in i 66)\n- i mod 4 == 1:\n  - (not (= in i 69))\n  - (= in i 70)\n- i mod 4 == 2:\n  - (not (= in i 73))\n  - (not (= in i 74))\n- i mod 4 == 3:\n  - (not (= in i 65))\n  - (= in i 66)\n\nYes, in3 matches in0 pattern to disallow 65 and require 66.\n\nSo variables mod 4 == 0 and mod 4 == 3 share the same constraints.\n\nNow, for the total N=25, we have indices in0 to in24.\n\nLet's write constraints per variable:\n\nFor i in 0..24:\n\n- if i mod 4 == 0 or 3:\n  - (not (= in i 65))\n  - (= in i 66)\n- if i mod 4 == 1:\n  - (not (= in i 69))\n  - (= in i 70)\n- if i mod 4 == 2:\n  - (not (= in i 73))\n  - (not (= in i 74))\n\nNo variable has two \"=\" constraints; only one per variable where applies.\n\nHence total constraints = for each variable 2 or 1 constraint depending on the case.\n\nVariables mod 4 == 2 have only two (not =) expressions, variables mod 4 == 0 or 3 have (not (= ... 65)) and (= ... 66), variables mod 4 ==1 have (not (= 69)) and (= 70).\n\nNow, let's form all constraints for i=0 to 24.\n\nGroup them all with a top-level (assert (and ...)).\n\nEach constraint is an S-expression with proper spacing.\n\nAlso, from examples, the (assert (and ...)) is one single and expression (with nested and's) but the instruction says all per-variable constraints must be combined using a top-level (assert (and ...)) clause.\n\nSo to keep canonical we just put (assert (and <all constraints>)) listing them separated by spaces.\n\nNo nested ands.\n\nSo final SMT-LIB will be:  \n(assert (and  \n  (not (= in0 65)) (= in0 66)  \n  (not (= in1 69)) (= in1 70)  \n  (not (= in2 73)) (not (= in2 74))  \n  (not (= in3 65)) (= in3 66)  \n  ... and so on up to in24  \n))\n\nFormat properly with spaces and proper parens as in examples.\n\nLet's write all constraints:\n\nFor i=0 to 24:\n\ni | i mod 4 | constraints  \n--|---------|----------------  \n0 | 0       | (not (= in0 65)) (= in0 66)  \n1 | 1       | (not (= in1 69)) (= in1 70)  \n2 | 2       | (not (= in2 73)) (not (= in2 74))  \n3 | 3       | (not (= in3 65)) (= in3 66)  \n4 | 0       | (not (= in4 65)) (= in4 66)  \n5 | 1       | (not (= in5 69)) (= in5 70)  \n6 | 2       | (not (= in6 73)) (not (= in6 74))  \n7 | 3       | (not (= in7 65)) (= in7 66)  \n8 | 0       | (not (= in8 65)) (= in8 66)  \n9 | 1       | (not (= in9 69)) (= in9 70)  \n10| 2       | (not (= in10 73)) (not (= in10 74))  \n11| 3       | (not (= in11 65)) (= in11 66)  \n12| 0       | (not (= in12 65)) (= in12 66)  \n13| 1       | (not (= in13 69)) (= in13 70)  \n14| 2       | (not (= in14 73)) (not (= in14 74))  \n15| 3       | (not (= in15 65)) (= in15 66)  \n16| 0       | (not (= in16 65)) (= in16 66)  \n17| 1       | (not (= in17 69)) (= in17 70)  \n18| 2       | (not (= in18 73)) (not (= in18 74))  \n19| 3       | (not (= in19 65)) (= in19 66)  \n20| 0       | (not (= in20 65)) (= in20 66)  \n21| 1       | (not (= in21 69)) (= in21 70)  \n22| 2       | (not (= in22 73)) (not (= in22 74))  \n23| 3       | (not (= in23 65)) (= in23 66)  \n24| 0       | (not (= in24 65)) (= in24 66)  \n\nNow write in final SMT-LIB format with spaces consistent with samples:\n\nE.g., for in0:\n\n(not ( = in0 65))\n\n( =  in0 66)\n\nNote the spaces between \"=\" and operands, and the two spaces before variable vs number as in examples.\n\nThe examples have double spaces before variable name and before number in \"=\" clauses.\n\nWe'll follow that exactly:\n\nE.g.:\n\n(not ( = in0 65))\n\n( =  in0 66)\n\nSo replicate exact spacing.\n\nFinal line will be:\n\n(assert (and (not ( = in0 65))  ( =  in0 66)  (not ( = in1 69))  ( =  in1 70)  (not ( = in2 73))  (not ( = in2 74))  (not ( = in3 65))  ( =  in3 66)  ... ))\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (not ( = in0 65))  ( =  in0 66)  (not ( = in1 69))  ( =  in1 70)  (not ( = in2 73))  (not ( = in2 74))  (not ( = in3 65))  ( =  in3 66)  (not ( = in4 65))  ( =  in4 66)  (not ( = in5 69))  ( =  in5 70)  (not ( = in6 73))  (not ( = in6 74))  (not ( = in7 65))  ( =  in7 66)  (not ( = in8 65))  ( =  in8 66)  (not ( = in9 69))  ( =  in9 70)  (not ( = in10 73))  (not ( = in10 74))  (not ( = in11 65))  ( =  in11 66)  (not ( = in12 65))  ( =  in12 66)  (not ( = in13 69))  ( =  in13 70)  (not ( = in14 73))  (not ( = in14 74))  (not ( = in15 65))  ( =  in15 66)  (not ( = in16 65))  ( =  in16 66)  (not ( = in17 69))  ( =  in17 70)  (not ( = in18 73))  (not ( = in18 74))  (not ( = in19 65))  ( =  in19 66)  (not ( = in20 65))  ( =  in20 66)  (not ( = in21 69))  ( =  in21 70)  (not ( = in22 73))  (not ( = in22 74))  (not ( = in23 65))  ( =  in23 66)  (not ( = in24 65))  ( =  in24 66)))</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2656, "completion_tokens": 2521, "total_tokens": 5177, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

(and\n\n              (and (>= in1 in0) (> in1 in0))\n\n              (>= in2 in0)\n\n          ) (> in2 in0))\n\n      )\n\n    )\n\n)) \n\nand so on.\n\nSo it starts nesting from the first pair `(>= in1 in0) ( > in1 in0)` and builds upward adding one pair of constraints at a time.\n\nWe will follow the same order:\n\nFor i from 1 to 15:\n\n  For j from 0 to i-1:\n\n    Add `(>= in_i in_j)` and `(> in_i in_j)`\n\nTotal: 240 constraints.\n\nFor N=16, this extends to i=15 (0-based indexing from 0 to 15).\n\nAlso includes the new row for `in15` comparing it to all `in0` to `in14`.\n\nThe final

The variables are named in0, in1, ..., in(N-1).\n2. Constraints are inequalities of the form (<= inX inY).\n3. The constraints are grouped in a multi-level nested (and ...), with a top-level (assert (and ...)).\n4. The inequalities appear to encode a partial order or hierarchy among groups of inputs.\n\nBy observing several constraints, particularly at larger N like 26 and 21, the pattern consists of blocks grouped roughly by powers of two minus one or intervals that group inputs and relate them with inequalities like:\n\n- within small consecutive sub-blocks, e.g., (<= in0 in1), (<= in2 in3) etc.\n- then combining these with relations like (<= in0 in2), (<= in1 in2), making the sub-blocks ordered as well.\n- then larger groups are connected by constraints like (<= in0 in4), ..., (<= in0 in7) etc.\n- at each level larger clusters are connected, ultimately chaining everything from in0 up to inN-1 through increasing layers.\n\nIn the N=26 example, the groups are (0-6), (7-12), (13-20), (21-25) roughly.\n\nFor N=27, following the pattern from N=26:\n\n- Identify groups like before: breaking 27 into groups similar to 26.\n\nFor N=26, the groups seen are:\n\n- Group0: in0..in6 (7 elements), with internal ordering and cross references.\n- Group1: in7..in12 (6 elements)\n- Group2: in13..in20 (8 elements)\n- Group3: in21..in25 (5 elements)\n\nFor N=27, presumably the next variable (in26) extends or nests in the last group, or forms a new one.\n\nLooking at the example pattern in detail:\n\n- At N=26:\n\n  - (<= in0 in1)\n  - (<= in2 in3)\n  - (<= in0 in2), (<= in1 in2)\n  - etc. for group 0 (0..6)\n  - group 1 (7..12)\n  - group 2 (13..20)\n  - group 3 (20..25)\n  - connections between groups following the same pattern.\n\nNote in N=26:\n\n- The last group is from 20 to 25.\n\nFor N=27, that last group likely extends to 26: i.e., from in20..in26.\n\nLooking at previous outer groups:\n\n- group 0 is in0..6 (7)\n- group 1 is in7..12 (6)\n- group 2 is in13..20 (8)\n- group 3 is in21..25 (5)\n\nGroup sizes are uneven; likely groupings are based on a tree structure balancing subtrees.\n\nSimilarly, the connections are made such that:\n\n- items within subgroups satisfy (<= inJ inK) pairs\n- then the subgroup roots are connected by (<= ...) to make a hierarchy\n\nGiven this complex pattern, a practical approach is to:\n\n- Use N=26 as template and add the (<= in26 inX) connections similarly.\n\nGoing step-by-step with last group:\n\nFor N=26 last group (in20..in25):\n\n( <=  in20 in21))\n( <=  in20 in22))\n( <=  in21 in22))\n( <=  in23 in24))\n( <=  in23 in25))\n( <=  in24 in25))\n( <=  in20 in23))\n( <=  in21 in23))\n( <=  in22 in23)) \n\nNow for in26, since N=27, where does in26 connect?\n\nFrom N=26 to N=27 difference: one more variable.\n\nLooking at 15 to 16 or 14 to 15:\n\n- The last group grows and includes the last variable.\n\nGiven this, likely the last group now is from in20..in26.\n\nThe pattern for groups of size >=2 is to have internal ordering inequalities for pairs and triples, e.g., (<= inX inY).\n\nThus, for the new variable in26, we would have:\n\n- A new set of inequalities such as:\n\n( <= in24 in25)\n( <= in24 in26)\n( <= in25 in26)\n\nand also connecting the root of the group:\n\n( <= in20 in24)\n\n( <= in21 in24)\n\n( <= in22 in24)\n\nor similar.\n\nAlso, the top root (in0) connects to the roots of the subtrees (in13, in20, ...), so we'd also add ( <=  in0 in13), ( <= in0 in20), ( <= in0 in27) [No in27, so we connect in0 to in20].\n\nBecause we don't have a full explicit expression for N=27, let's build it following the previous N=26 pattern, adding the new variable in26 connected appropriately.\n\nI will enumerate constraints similarly to N=26, with additional constraints considering in26.\n\n---\n\n**Constraints**\n\nGroup 1: in0..6\n\nThe constraints do not change, as N=27 extends beyond 6, so keep as is:\n\n( <=  in0 in1)  \n( <=  in2 in3)  \n( <=  in0 in2)  \n( <=  in1 in2)  \n( <=  in4 in5)  \n( <=  in4 in6)  \n( <=  in5 in6)  \n( <=  in0 in4)  \n( <=  in1 in4)  \n( <=  in2 in4)  \n( <=  in3 in4)  \n\nGroup 2: in7..12, same as N=26:\n\n( <=  in7 in8)  \n( <=  in7 in9)  \n( <=  in8 in9)  \n( <=  in10 in11)  \n( <=  in10 in12)  \n( <=  in11 in12)  \n( <=  in7 in10)  \n( <=  in8 in10)  \n( <=  in9 in10)  \n( <=  in0 in7)  \n( <=  in1 in7)  \n( <=  in2 in7)  \n( <=  in3 in7)  \n( <=  in4 in7)  \n( <=  in5 in7)  \n( <=  in6 in7)  \n\nGroup 3: in13..20, from N=26:\n\n( <=  in13 in14)  \n( <=  in15 in16)  \n( <=  in13 in15)  \n( <=  in14 in15)  \n( <=  in17 in18)  \n( <=  in17 in19)  \n( <=  in18 in19)  \n( <=  in13 in17)  \n( <=  in14 in17)  \n( <=  in15 in17)  \n( <=  in16 in17)  \n\nConnecting in0 to this group as before:\n\n( <=  in0 in13)  \n( <=  in1 in13)  \n( <=  in2 in13)  \n( <=  in3 in13)  \n( <=  in4 in13)  \n( <=  in5 in13)  \n( <=  in6 in13)  \n\nGroup 4: in20..26 now (expanded from in20..25 before)\n\nFrom N=26 example, group last was:\n\n( <=  in20 in21)  \n( <=  in20 in22)  \n( <=  in21 in22)  \n( <=  in23 in24)  \n( <=  in23 in25)  \n( <=  in24 in25)  \n( <=  in20 in23)  \n( <=  in21 in23)  \n( <=  in22 in23)  \n\nNow for in26:\n\nWe can assume similar structure but extending nodes:\n\nGroup is in20..26\n\nSo subgroups may be:\n\n- in20..22 (like before: 20,21,22)\n- in23..26 (new, size 4: 23,24,25,26)\n\nThen in23..26 has its own small hierarchy:\n\nFor 4 elements in23..26:\n\n- ( <= in23 in24)\n- ( <= in25 in26)\n- ( <= in23 in25)\n- ( <= in24 in25)\n\nto fit pattern of N=14 (which has subgroups of 4 with similar inequalities).\n\nGiven no explicit rules stated, but given N=26 pattern, we use the following for group in23..26:\n\n( <=  in23 in24)  \n( <=  in25 in26)  \n( <=  in23 in25)  \n( <=  in24 in25)  \n\nThen connections from 20..26 subgroup root:\n\n( <=  in20 in23)  \n( <=  in21 in23)  \n( <=  in22 in23)  \n\nAnd top-level connections:\n\n( <=  in0 in20)  \n( <=  in1 in20)  \n( <=  in2 in20)  \n( <=  in3 in20)  \n( <=  in4 in20)  \n( <=  in5 in20)  \n( <=  in6 in20)  \n\nAll these composed with the previous constraints.\n\n---\n\nNow let's count how many constraints and nesting of (and)s.\n\nFrom previous examples, each constraint is wrapped in nested (and)s.\n\nThe output must be of the form:\n\n(assert (and ...constraints...))\n\nwith constraints nested in (and (and ... ) (and ...)) to the level shown in the examples.\n\nSince the problem gives examples with nesting of (and (and ...)) matching the number of constraints minus one, we need to replicate this nesting with the total number of constraints for N=27.\n\n---\n\n**Counting constraints:**\n\nGroup 1 (0..6):\n\n- ( <= in0 in1)\n- ( <= in2 in3)\n- ( <= in0 in2)\n- ( <= in1 in2)\n- ( <= in4 in5)\n- ( <= in4

(not (= in0 1)) (= (mod in0 2) 0)) ... ))))\n\nSo each per-variable constraint is like:\n\n(and  \n (not (= inX 1))  \n (= (mod inX 2) 0)  \n (not (= (div inX 2) 1))  \n (= (mod (div inX 2) 2) 0)  \n (not (= (div (div inX 2) 2) 1))  \n)\n\nAnd the top-level is nested (and ...) combining all variables similarly as in the examples.\n\nI will generate and output the SMT-LIB assertion accordingly.\n\n</think>  \n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (not (= in0 1)) (= (mod in0 2) 0)) (not (= (div in0 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in0 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in0 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in1 1))) (= (mod in1 2) 0)) (not (= (div in1 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in1 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in1 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in2 1))) (= (mod in2 2) 0)) (not (= (div in2 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in2 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in2 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in3 1))) (= (mod in3 2) 0)) (not (= (div in3 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in3 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in3 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in4 1))) (= (mod in4 2) 0)) (not (= (div in4 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in4 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in4 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in5 1))) (= (mod in5 2) 0)) (not (= (div in5 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in5 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in5 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in6 1))) (= (mod in6 2) 0)) (not (= (div in6 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in6 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in6 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in7 1))) (= (mod in7 2) 0)) (not (= (div in7 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in7 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in7 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in8 1))) (= (mod in8 2) 0)) (not (= (div in8 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in8 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in8 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in9 1))) (= (mod in9 2) 0)) (not (= (div in9 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in9 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in9 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in10 1))) (= (mod in10 2) 0)) (not (= (div in10 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in10 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in10 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in11 1))) (= (mod in11 2) 0)) (not (= (div in11 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in11 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in11 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in12 1))) (= (mod in12 2) 0)) (not (= (div in12 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in12 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in12 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in13 1))) (= (mod in13 2) 0)) (not (= (div in13 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in13 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in13 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in14 1))) (= (mod in14 2) 0)) (not (= (div in14 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in14 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in14 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in15 1))) (= (mod in15 2) 0)) (not (= (div in15 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in15 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in15 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in16 1))) (= (mod in16 2) 0)) (not (= (div in16 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in16 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in16 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in17 1))) (= (mod in17 2) 0)) (not (= (div in17 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in17 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in17 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in18 1))) (= (mod in18 2) 0)) (not (= (div in18 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in18 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in18 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in19 1))) (= (mod in19 2) 0)) (not (= (div in19 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in19 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in19 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in20 1))) (= (mod in20 2) 0)) (not (= (div in20 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in20 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in20 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in21 1))) (= (mod in21 2) 0)) (not (= (div in21 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in21 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in21 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in22 1))) (= (mod in22 2) 0)) (not (= (div in22 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in22 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in22 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in23 1))) (= (mod in23 2) 0)) (not (= (div in23 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in23 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in23 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in24 1))) (= (mod in24 2) 0)) (not (= (div in24 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in24 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in24 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in25 1))) (= (mod in25 2) 0)) (not (= (div in25 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in25 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in25 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in26 1))) (= (mod in26 2) 0)) (not (= (div in26 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in26 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in26 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in27 1))) (= (mod in27 2) 0)) (not (= (div in27 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in27 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in27 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in28 1))) (= (mod in28 2) 0)) (not (= (div in28 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in28 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in28 2) 2) 1))) (not (= in29 1))) (= (mod in29 2) 0)) (not (= (div in29 2) 1))) (= (mod (div in29 2) 2) 0)) (not (= (div (div in29 2) 2) 1)))))))</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4051, "completion_tokens": 3267, "total_tokens": 7318, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

Or maybe they capped the repeated and to 10 for display consistency?\n\nWait - The provided examples for all N >= 2 all have 10 nested (and's, meaning 10 constraints, of which:\n\n- 2 constraints for in0 (>=0 and <=10)\n- then 8 constraints for in1 nested subtractions?\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nThe first two constraints in all examples:\n\n(>= in0 0)\n(<= in0 10)\n\nThen the remaining 8 constraints are all nested (>) on in1 and further nested subtractions.\n\nSince the logic is about N, the difference seems to be the count of nested (>) constraints after these first two.\n\nBut all examples have exactly 10 nested (and's total. \n\nI deduce that possibly the pattern shown is a fixed example, but the inner nested (>) expressions increase with N.\n\nSo for N=12, the number of (>) constraints after (>= in0 0) and (<= in0 10) is N, and the braces are nested accordingly.\n\nEach (>) condition is nested inside (and ... (and ... ) ...) format, deepening each time.\n\nThus the solution for N=12 will have:\n\n- an outer (assert (and ...) ...)\n\n- inside (and ... ... ) chained 12 times:\n\n    - first: (>= in0 0)\n\n    - second: (<= in0 10)\n\n    - third: (> in1 1)\n\n    - fourth: (> (- in1 1) 1)\n\n    - fifth: (> (- (- in1 1) 1) 1)\n\n    ...\n\n    Until the 12th condition: which is (>) applied to a chain of 11 nested (- ... 1) expressions starting from in1.\n\nBut noticed in the examples, the rightmost nested (>) expression count is 10 for N=10 or N=11.\n\nSo probably the number of such \">\" expressions on in1 is always N-1.\n\nActually, the example N=10 has 10 nested ands, matching the constraint count.\n\nThus for N=12, will have:\n\n- (>= in0 0) and (<= in0 10)  as first 2 constraints\n\n- then 10 constraints for N=10 on in1 nested subtractions (in the example)\n\n- For N=12, we need to add two more (>) constraints on even deeper nested subtracts.\n\nSo total constraints = N, which means 12 constraints total.\n\nGiven in all examples the fixed first two constraints are on in0 and the rest on in1, and the nested subtracting by 1 each time.\n\nSo the final SMT-LIB assertion would be:\n\n(assert (and ...  )) where inside the and are the 12 constraints: first two on in0, then 10 on in1 nested subtractions.\n\nWe also need to mirror the nested (and (and ... ) ... ) format exactly as in the examples.\n\nSpecifically, each pair of constraints is wrapped by an (and ... ...). For example, for N=2, we get 10 nested (and)'s even though only two variables involved?\n\nWait, the examples are confusing because many deeply nested (and (and ...)) chains, but inside, only two variables in0 and in1.\n\nGiven the input slightly differs from expected, but matches in the example: the pattern for all N values looks identical except the number of nested (>) conditions on in1 keeps growing.\n\nWait! The provided examples for N=2 up to N=11 are actually identical! They all have exactly the same structure and number of nested ands (10), which means maybe the examples are stub examples that always go 10 times.\n\nGiven that, the question is: \"What is the constraint for N=12\"?\n\nGiven the examples, the pattern for constraints on in0 is always:\n\n(>= in0 0) and (<= in0 10)\n\nThe rest are constraints on in1 that impose:\n\n( > in1 1)\n\n( > (- in1 1) 1)\n\n( > (- (- in1 1) 1) 1)\n\n...\n\nrepeated, say, K times.\n\nThe examples show the nested (and) with exactly 10 constraints after the in0 two constraints.\n\nIf the pattern is for N constraints after in0 constraints (which appear fixed), for N=12, we'd have 12 constraints for in1 nested subtractions.\n\nBut question states \"All per-variable constraints must be combined in one top-level (assert (and ... ))\", so we produce it as:\n\n(assert (and (>= in0 0) (<= in0 10) ... all N in1 constraints ... ))\n\nwhere the in1 constraints are:\n\n(> in1 1)\n\n(> (- in1 1) 1)\n\n(> (- (- in1 1) 1) 1)\n\n(> (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1)\n\n...\n\ntill the 12th such constraint, which does 11 nested subtractions.\n\nFurthermore, due to the sample format, it is better to write the nested combination as a single (assert (and ... )) combining all constraints as flat as possible, no nested (and (and ...)).\n\nHence, for N=12, output should be:\n\n(assert (and  \n  (>= in0 0)  \n  (<= in0 10)  \n  (> in1 1)  \n  (> (- in1 1) 1)  \n  (> (- (- in1 1) 1) 1)  \n  (> (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1)  \n  (> (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)  \n  (> (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)  \n  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)  \n  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)  \n  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)  \n  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)  \n  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)  \n))\n\nNote: each next constraint nests one more (- ... 1).\n\nThis matches the pattern for previous N.\n\nThe only difference is adding one more nested (>) constraint for N=12.\n\nThis is the final expected output.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(\nassert (and \n  (>= in0 0) \n  (<= in0 10) \n  (> in1 1) \n  (> (- in1 1) 1) \n  (> (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) \n  (> (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) \n  (> (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) \n  (> (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) \n  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) \n  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) \n  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) \n  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) \n  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)\n)\n)</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2436, "completion_tokens": 2193, "total_tokens": 4629, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

( + in1 in0)))) t))`\n\nThen i=1:\n\n- `(not (= in1 t))`\n- `(not (= ( + in2 in1) t))`\n- `(not (= ( + in3 ( + in2 in1)) t))`\n- ...\n- `(not (= ( + in11 ( + in10 ( + ... ( + in2 in1)))) t))`\n\netc.\n\nHence for sum(n to m):\n\nWe build nested `( + ... )` starting from in_i up to in_j.\n\nThe building of sums can be done by a recursive or iterative approach.\n\nSummary:\n\n- Define function build_sum(i,j): return nested `( + in_j ( + in_j-1 ( ... ( + in_i in_i) ... )) )`\n\nbut since base is just `in_i` when i == j.\n\nExample:\n\nbuild_sum(0,0) = in0\n\nbuild_sum(0,1) = `( + in1 in0)`\n\nbuild_sum(0,2) = `( + in2 ( + in1 in0))`\n\nand so forth.\n\nSo write function to build sums.\n\nNow implement the chain of nested `(and ...)` clauses:\n\nFor every atomic constraint we will wrap the previous accumulated `(and ...)` with `(and <previous> <new>)`\n\nStart with last clause, nesting upwards.\n\nFinally `(assert (and ...))`\n\n---\n\nLet's proceed to construct that SMT-LIB string.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n(assert (and (>= in0

For clarity, let's analyze the N=23 constraint which is the latest available before 25:\n\nFrom N=23:\n\n- First level groups:\n  - (in0, in1, in2)\n  - (in3, in4, in5)\n  - (in6, in7, in8, in9, in10, in11)\n  - (in12, in13, in14)\n  - (in15, in16, in17)\n  - (in18, in19, in20)\n  - (in21, in22)\n\n- Within these groups, orderings are specified.\n- Then higher level constraints link the groups together, e.g., (<= in0 in3), (<= in6 in9), etc.\n- The tree layers propagate constraints upwards to combine the smaller segments.\n\nNow for N=25, since N=23 uses input indices 0 through 22, N=25 have inputs in0 to in24.\n\nLikely the structure of groups will follow splitting inputs into powers of two or close to it along balanced merges.\n\nTry to identify groups for 25 inputs:\n\n- The closest balanced division may break inputs into groups similarly as for 23 but extended.\n\nFrom examples:\n\n- For N=23, after splitting the leftmost 12 inputs (indices 0 to 11) into smaller groups (similar from N=11 and N=12), the right parts are split into groups starting at 12: (12..14), (15..17), (18..20), (21..22).\n\nFor N=25, similarly, let's consider grouping inputs roughly into:\n\n- Left half: in0 .. in11 (12 elements)\n- Next group: in12 .. in17 (6 elements)\n- Next group: in18 .. in21 (4 elements)\n- Next group: in22 .. in24 (3 elements)\n\nThis roughly partitions 25 inputs: 12 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 25.\n\nWithin each of these, the constraints apply recursively from smaller N to bigger.\n\nUsing pieces from existing constraints and extending for indices 23 and 24, let's write expected constraints:\n\n1. First group (in0..in11):\n\nFrom the N=11 case, includes constraints like:\n\n```\n( <=  in0 in1)\n( <=  in0 in2)\n( <=  in1 in2)\n( <=  in3 in4)\n( <=  in3 in5)\n( <=  in4 in5)\n( <=  in0 in3)\n( <=  in1 in3)\n( <=  in2 in3)\n( <=  in6 in7)\n( <=  in6 in8)\n( <=  in7 in8)\n( <=  in9 in10)\n( <=  in6 in9)\n( <=  in7 in9)\n( <=  in8 in9)\n( <=  in0 in6)\n( <=  in1 in6)\n( <=  in2 in6)\n( <=  in3 in6)\n( <=  in4 in6)\n( <=  in5 in6)\n```\n\n2. Second group (in12..in17) (6 elements):\n\nThis is like the pattern for N=6 (or N=7):\n\n```\n(<= in12 in13)\n(<= in12 in14)\n(<= in13 in14)\n(<= in15 in16)\n(<= in15 in17)\n(<= in16 in17)\n(<= in12 in15)\n(<= in13 in15)\n(<= in14 in15)\n```\n\n3. Third group (in18..in21) (4 elements):\n\nThis behaves like N=4 example (group of 4 inputs):\n\n```\n(<= in18 in19)\n(<= in19 in20)\n(<= in18 in20)\n(<= in21 in21) // in21 alone\u2014in fact 21..22 is 2 elements, 4 elements are 18..21? No, 18..21 implies 4 inputs: in18 in19 in20 in21\nWe see from examples groups of 4 inputs are typically constrained as all pairwise up in that group.\n\nExample from N=7:\n\n(<= in4 in5) (<= in4 in6) (<= in5 in6) (<= in0 in4) ...\n\nBut for 4 elements it seems to be constraints within the group and constraints linking groups.\n\nFor group in18..in21 (4 elements), we may see:\n\n```\n(<= in18 in19)\n(<= in19 in20)\n(<= in18 in20)\n(<= in21 in21) - trivial, single element\n(<= in18 in21)\n(<= in19 in21)\n(<= in20 in21)\n```\n\nCheck from N=20 example (in15..in19) group examples for 5 elements.\n\n3rd group is likely (in18..in21) with constraints similarly linking:\n\n```\n( <= in18 in19)\n( <= in18 in20)\n( <= in19 in20)\n( <= in21 in22)\n...\n```\n\nWait, from N=23 example:\n\n- Grouping (in18..in20) and (in21..in22) are split separately.\n\nSo for N=25, if we treat inputs (18..20) and (21..22) as before and now add (23..24) as a new group of 2 elements.\n\n- So let's divide as:\n\n-- (18..20): 3 elements\n\n-- (21..22): 2 elements\n\n-- (23..24): 2 elements\n\nThe constraints for (23..24) will be:\n\n(<= in23 in24)\n\nFor group (21..22):\n\n(<= in21 in22)\n\nFor group (18..20):\n\n(<= in18 in19)\n\n(<= in19 in20)\n\n(<= in18 in20)\n\nNow, the groups combine:\n\n(<= in18 in21) (<= in19 in21) (<= in20 in21)\n\n(<= in21 in23) (<= in22 in23)\n\n(<= in23 in23) trivial\n\n(<= in23 in24)\n\nNow groups merge upwards:\n\n(<= in0 in12) linking first and second\n\n(<= in12 in18) linking second and third\n\n(<= in18 in23) linking third and fourth\n\nThis would be consistent with previous examples for linking groups.\n\nAlso from previous examples, first group (0..11), second group (12..17), third group (18..22), now extended to 18..24 in chunks.\n\nPut it all together, combining constraints from each group and the linkage between groups.\n\n---\n\nNow let's collect constraints in SMT-LIB format:\n\nBreakdown:\n\nGroup 1 (0..11):\n\n(<= in0 in1) (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2)\n\n(<= in3 in4) (<= in3 in5) (<= in4 in5)\n\n(<= in0 in3) (<= in1 in3) (<= in2 in3)\n\n(<= in6 in7) (<= in6 in8) (<= in7 in8)\n\n(<= in9 in10) (<= in6 in9) (<= in7 in9) (<= in8 in9)\n\n(<= in0 in6) (<= in1 in6) (<= in2 in6) (<= in3 in6) (<= in4 in6) (<= in5 in6)\n\nGroup 2 (12..17):\n\n(<= in12 in13) (<= in12 in14) (<= in13 in14)\n\n(<= in15 in16) (<= in15 in17) (<= in16 in17)\n\n(<= in12 in15) (<= in13 in15) (<= in14 in15)\n\nGroup 3 (18..20):\n\n(<= in18 in19) (<= in19 in20) (<= in18 in20)\n\nGroup 4 (21..22):\n\n(<= in21 in22)\n\nGroup 5 (23..24):\n\n(<= in23 in24)\n\nGroup linkages:\n\n(<= in0 in12) (<= in1 in12) (<= in2 in12) (<= in3 in12) (<= in4 in12) (<= in5 in12) (<= in6 in12) (<= in7 in12) (<= in8 in12) (<= in9 in12) (<= in10 in12) (<= in11 in12)\n\n(<= in12 in18) (<= in13 in18) (<= in14 in18) (<= in15 in18) (<= in16 in18) (<= in17 in18)\n\n(<= in18 in21) (<= in19 in21) (<= in20 in21)\n\n(<= in21 in23) (<= in22 in23)\n\n(<= in23 in23) trivial, ignore\n\n(<= in23 in24)\n\n---\n\nWait, also from N=23 we had constraints like (<= in9 in11) for groupings inside 6 element groups.

There are inequalities of the form (not (= ... t)) where the terms not equal to t are partial sums of the input variables.\n4. The partial sums considered are sums starting at each input index i, summing a contiguous sequence up to j, where j >= i.\n5. Specifically, each constraint is (not (= sum_in[i..j] t)) for all i,j with 0 <= i <= j < N.\n6. Additionally, each single input variable (apart from in0) is also tested both directly and as part of sums starting from that variable.\n\nMore precisely for N=11, the constraints include:\n- Bounds for in0...in10: (>= in_i -10) and (<= in_i 10) for i in 0..10\n- Bounds for t: (>= t -100) and (<= t 100)\n- For each starting index i in 0..10 and ending index j in i..10:\n  (not (= (sum of in_i to in_j) t))\n- For each i in 1..10, also (not (= in_i t)) individually.\n\nWait, correction for the last part:\n\nLooking at N=11 example:\n\n- The first big block of (not (= ... t)) constraints correspond to sums starting at 0 to j for j in [0..10].\n- Then next block corresponds to sums starting at 1 to j for j in [1..10] plus (not (= in1 t))\n- Then sums starting at 2 to j for j in [2..10] plus (not (= in2 t))\n- ...\n- And so on until i=10 where only (not (= in10 t))\n\nThus for each i in 0..N-1:\n- For j in i..N-1:\n  (not (= sum_in[i..j] t))\n- For i>0: also (not (= in_i t))\n\nFor i=0, the single term (not (= in0 t)) is included as part of sums (sum_in[0..0] in0 in0) = in0, so it's already there.\n\nHence the \"single-variable\" constraints for i>0 are added explicitly, appear as (not (= in_i t)).\n\nNow the sums need to be constructed.\n\nWe also notice the sums are nested additions of the form:\n\nFor sum i..j: \nif i=j -> in_i\nelse -> (+ in_j sum_in[i..(j-1)])\n\nWe must generate these sums for N=12 (in0 ... in11):\n\n- Per variable constraints:\n  For i in 0..11: (>= in_i -10), (<= in_i 10)\n- Bounds on t\n- For i in 0..11:\n  For j in i..11:\n    (not (= sum_in[i..j] t))\n- For i in 1..11:\n    (not (= in_i t))\n\nAll wrapped inside a top-level (assert (and ...)) combining all constraints.\n\n[We also notice that the SMT-LIB output uses a lot of nested (and ...). According to the prompt, all per-variable constraints must be combined in a top-level (assert (and ...)) clause. So we can write them all flat inside one big (and ...).\n\nTherefore, the structure is:\n\n(assert (and \n  (>= in0 -10) (<= in0 10)\n  ...\n  (>= in11 -10) (<= in11 10)\n  (>= t -100) (<= t 100)\n  \n  all (not (= sum_in[i..j] t)) for 0 <= i <= j <= 11\n  all (not (= in_i t)) for i=1..11\n))\n\nFor the sums, we need an efficient way to write them:\n\nsum_in[i..j] = in_j if i==j\nsum_in[i..j] = (+ in_j sum_in[i..j-1]) if j>i\n\nWe must write these terms explicitly.\n\nKnowing that for example for i=0, j=3:\n\n( + in3 ( + in2 ( + in1 in0)))\n\nSimilarly for all other sums.\n\nWe will construct the sums from the inside out for each (i,j).\n\nProceeding to write all constraints accordingly.\n\nFinally, return the final SMT-LIB constraint string.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and

So these are redundant? The examples include both `(not (= ink t))` and `(not (= sum t))` where sum is `in k` alone or with others?\n\nIn example N=5:\n\n```\n(not (= in0 t))\n(not (= ( + in1 in0) t))\n(not (= ( + in2 ( + in1 in0)) t))\n...\n```\n\nand also separately\n\n```\n(not (= in1 t))\n(not (= in2 t))\n...\n```\n\nSo the single-variable `(not (= ink t))` appears separately for each variable.\n\nTherefore, do all sums for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 j < N, then single variable separately too.\n\nThe sums from i to j with j >= i, excluding the single variables sums already included as separate constraints? No, sum from i to j can include length 1 sums, which are the single variables, but those are already separately included, so probably both included redundantly in the examples (or those single variable sums in the 'sum' list are not included separately).\n\nLooking carefully, example N=5:\n\nThe `(not (= in0 t))` is explicitly separately listed.\n\nThe sum lists start from `( + in1 in0)`, i.e., sums of length >= 2.\n\nNo `(not (= in0 t))` inside the sum list (sum of just in0).\n\nTherefore, sums for lengths >= 2 only.\n\nTherefore,\n\n- Single variables: `(not (= ink t))` for k in 0..N-1\n- Sums of length \u2265 2: `(not (= sum t))` where sum is nested sum of consecutive inputs for lengths from 2 to N.\n\nThat matches the examples.\n\nSo formula building:\n\n- For variables in0..in15: `(>= inX -10)` and `(<= inX 10)`\n\n- For t: `(>= t -100)`, `(<= t 100)`\n\n- `(not (= in0 t))` ... `(not (= in15 t))`\n\n- For lengths L in 2..16:\n    For start indices i in [0..N-L]:\n        Build sum of `in i` to `in i+L-1` as nested addition\n\n---\n\nNow I'll write the SMT-LIB constraint string exactly as required.\n\nNo extras or comments.\n\n---\n\nNote: The addition nesting is always right-associative.\n\nFor example, for sum `in0 + in1 + in2`:\n\n`( + in2 ( + in1 in0))`\n\nSimilarly, for `in0 + ... + in15`, it's:\n\n`( + in15 ( + in14 ( + in13 ( + in12 ( + in11 ( + in10 (

The constraints involve pairwise comparisons `(<= inX inY)` between inputs.\n2. They often compare inputs within blocks, then compare blocks with each other.\n3. Larger Ns are formed by merging smaller blocks constrained in previous steps.\n4. For example:\n   - N=6 shows comparisons within groups (0..2) and (3..5) and some cross-group constraints.\n   - N=7 and N=8 introduce new comparisons within subgroups and merges.\n\nWe can guess the pattern is to enforce ordering on sub-blocks, then merge them pairwise with constraints on their inputs.\n\n### Let's take the latest significant example, N=10:\n\n(remember a lot of nested `and` s, but the key constraints are):\n\n- `(<= in0 in1) (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2)` ordering the first three inputs into some order.\n- `(<= in3 in4)` similarly ordering another pair.\n- Then comparisons involving in0, in1, in2 with in3 and in4.\n- `(<= in5 in6) (<= in5 in7) (<= in6 in7)` ordering a group 5..7.\n- `(<= in8 in9)` ordering 8 and 9.\n- Then merging and comparing inputs across groups.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\nThe constraints are encoding merging of \"sorted\" sub-blocks in a bitonic or merge network style.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy to generate constraints for N=15:\n\nTry to break 15 into groups based on the previous examples approach:\n\n- For N=9: three blocks of size 3:\n\n  Blocks:\n  - block1: in0,in1,in2\n  - block2: in3,in4\n  - block3: in5,in6,in7,in8?\n\nActually from the example N=9:\n\n- there\u2019s ordering on in0,in1,in2\n- on in3,in4\n- on in5,in6,in7 and in7,in8\n\nIndicating blocks of size 3, 2, ...\n  \nFor N=15, probably working with blocks of size powers of two or close:\n\nTry blocks:\n- block A: in0..in4 (5 elements)\n- block B: in5..in9 (5 elements)\n- block C: in10..in14 (5 elements)\n\nThen order each block internally with constraints similar to smaller N=5 or N=6?\n\nFrom previous pattern:\n\n- Within each block: all pairwise constraints needed to sort that block\n- Then constraints to merge those three sorted blocks\n\n---\n\nGiven the examples, the \"merge\" constraints usually involve:\n\n- Enforcing order within smaller sets first (like_triplets `(<= in0 in1) (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2)`).\n- Then enforcing order within pairs.\n- Then enforcing order cross groups.\n\n---\n\nBreak down N=15 into three groups each of 5 elements:\n\n1.

Looking at the pattern in previous examples, they always compare blocks in cascade:\n\n- For N=9: group 0 and 1 are compared, then 1 and 2 compared, not 0 and 2 directly.\n\nSo let's not add direct 0-2 merges besides via middle group.\n\n---\n\n### Also, within groups, for some smaller subsets, they add all pairwise constraints between triples.\n\nFor example, for group0 with 5 inputs, one way is to apply the pattern repeated:\n\n- Compare all triples for ordering (0,1,2), and (3,4) pairs, then comparisons between the parts (0..2) and (3,4).\n\nThus, it fits the pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Finally, combine constraints all under one `(assert (and ... ))` clause with minimal nesting as shown.\n\nThe examples nest many `(and (and ...))` but the final output is within a single `(assert (and ...))`.\n\nBut to conform to the examples, I will wrap with nested `(and ...)` wrapping pairwise constraints. \n\n---\n\n### Building nested `(and)` properly:\n\nFrom above, there are 7 comparisons in each group, three groups => 21 constraints.\n\nPlus merging constraints:\n\n- 5 comparisons between group0 and group1\n- 5 comparisons between group1 and group2\n\nTotal constraints: 21 + 10 = 31\n\n---\n\n### Build the nested (and ...) clauses carefully:\n\nEvery `(and a b)` is nested on right via `(and a (and b ...))`.\n\nSo with many constraints, this will be a chain of nested `(and (<= ...)

65)) (= 66)\n- in1, in4, in7, in10, in13: (not (= 69)) (= 70)\n- in2, in5, in8, in11, in14: (not (= 73)) (not (= 74))\n\nLet's enumerate constraints per variable:\n\nin0: (not (= in0 65)) ( = in0 66)\nin1: (not (= in1 69)) ( = in1 70)\nin2: (not (= in2 73)) (not (= in2 74))\nin3: (not (= in3 65)) ( = in3 66)\nin4: (not (= in4 69)) ( = in4 70)\nin5: (not (= in5 73)) (not (= in5 74))\nin6: (not (= in6 65)) ( = in6 66)\nin7: (not (= in7 69)) ( = in7 70)\nin8: (not (= in8 73)) (not (= in8 74))\nin9: (not (= in9 65)) ( = in9 66)\nin10: (not (= in10 69)) ( = in10 70)\nin11: (not (= in11 73)) (not (= in11 74))\nin12: (not (= in12 65)) ( = in12 66)\nin13: (not (= in13 69)) ( = in13 70)\nin14: (not (= in14 73)) (not (= in14 74))\nin15: (not (= in15 65)) ( = in15 66)\n\nWe must combine all these into a single (assert (and ...)) where inside the and clause, all these constraints appear with proper nested (and), following the example format.\n\nFrom prior examples, each top-level (assert (and ...)) contains a nested pattern (and (...)(...)) going one level at a time, all the way down.\n\nWe'll replicate the structure with repeated (and (...)(...)) until all constraints are included.\n\nThe number of constraints per variable is 2 always, so for 16 variables, total constraints = 16*2 = 32.\n\nThe canonical SMT-LIB format is strict: spaces, parentheses as shown, no extra commentary.\n\nNote from the examples how each (and (...)(...)) combines two constraints or nested (and)s in a binary tree manner.\n\nWe'll generate the nested (and)s by combining pairs repeatedly.\n\nSteps:\n\n- List all constraints as leaf nodes (32 total)\n- Pair them 2 at a time with (and ... ...), then pair resulting nodes again with (and ... ...), etc., until one top-level (and ... ...)\n\nBecause 32 is power of 2, this fully binary pairing will produce a balanced binary tree of (and) nodes.\n\nFinally, wrap in (assert ...)\n\nLet's generate the leaves:\n\nFor each variable in0..in15:\n\nIndex formula:\n\nIf i mod 3 == 0:\n\n  (not (= in{i} 65)) ( = in{i} 66)\n\nIf i mod 3 == 1:\n\n  (not (= in{i} 69)) ( = in{i} 70)\n\nIf i mod 3 == 2:\n\n  (not (= in{i} 73)) (not (= in{i} 74))\n\nLeaves list (32 constraints):\n\nin0: (not (= in0 65))\n\nin0: ( = in0 66)\n\nin1: (not (= in1 69))\n\nin1: ( = in1 70)\n\nin2: (not (= in2 73))\n\nin2: (not (= in2 74))\n\nin3: (not (= in3 65))\n\nin3: ( = in3 66)\n\nin4: (not (= in4 69))\n\nin4: ( = in4 70)\n\nin5: (not (= in5 73))\n\nin5: (not (= in5 74))\n\nin6: (not (= in6 65))\n\nin6: ( = in6 66)\n\nin7: (not (= in7 69))\n\nin7: ( = in7 70)\n\nin8: (not (= in8 73))\n\nin8: (not (= in8 74))\n\nin9: (not (= in9 65))\n\nin9: ( = in9 66)\n\nin10: (not (= in10 69))\n\nin10: ( = in10 70)\n\nin11: (not (= in11 73))\n\nin11: (not (= in11 74))\n\nin12: (not (= in12 65))\n\nin12: ( = in12 66)\n\nin13: (not (= in13 69))\n\nin13: ( = in13 70)\n\nin14: (not (= in14 73))\n\nin14: (not (= in14 74))\n\nin15: (not (= in15 65))\n\nin15: ( = in15 66)\n\nNow, we pair constraints in left-to-right order:\n\nFor example, first pair:\n\n(and first second)\n\nthen next pairs:\n\nContinuing until all combined into a single nested (and) expression.\n\nThis will produce a nested tree similar to previous examples.\n\nWe will format all per example.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and

Actually let's check N=29 snippet for that group:\n\n```\n( <=  in26 in27))  ( <=  in26 in28))  ( <=  in27 in28))\n```\nSo a \"fully ordered\" triple inside the group.\n\nAdding in29 means we create a quadruple or start a new triple? Usually grouping-triplets is key.\n\nSince N=30, we can think of groups of three triplets again.\n\nThe first 27 inputs (in0..in26) are as before, now we have in27, in28, in29.\n\nThe last group of three inputs should be (in27, in28, in29).\n\nLet's reproduce constraints for (in27, in28, in29):\n\n- (<= in27 in28)\n- (<= in27 in29)\n- (<= in28 in29)\n\nThen these three grouped constraints need to fit into the hierarchy: this group (in27,28,29) merges into the group (in22,23,24) and higher levels.\n\nFrom N=29, the last hierarchy was:\n\nGroup1: in22,in23,in24  \nGroup2: in26,in27,in28\n\nBut in N=29, the group2 is (26,27,28).\n\nNow in N=30, in29 is new; so last group is (27,28,29).\n\nSo probably the group (in22, in23, in24) still exists.\n\nHence need to redefine grouping at the last level.\n\nFrom pattern on N=29:\n\n- Between groups:\n\n(<= in22 in26), (<= in23 in26), (<= in24 in26), (<= in25 in26)  \nSeems in25 is mentioned but is part of N=29 inputs. For N=30, in25 still exists.\n\nIn N=29, the last group appears to be:\n\n- highest group nodes: in15 - in22 - in26\n\nSo new groups might be:\n\n- Group A: in22, in23, in24, in25, in26 (5 inputs) - probably split into triples & pairs.\n\nFor N=30, we can form groups of 3 inputs for hierarchical ordering:\n\nGroups of three:\n\n- 0..2  \n- 3..5  \n- 6..8  \n- 9..11  \n- 12..14  \n- 15..17  \n- 18..20  \n- 21..23  \n- 24..26  \n- 27..29\n\nActually, 30 inputs = 10 groups of 3 inputs.\n\nThen groups of groups:\n\n- Level 1: 10 groups of 3 inputs = 30 inputs\n\n- Level 2: group these 10 groups into 4 groups of 3 inputs, but 10 is not divisible by 3.\n\nLikely the pattern is to cluster groups of 3 and then cluster higher levels with the remainder.\n\nFor N=29, the SI example does not seem exactly to cluster in strict groups of 3 perfectly at higher levels.\n\nBut at the input level, the triple-wise constraints are consistently applied.\n\nTherefore for N=30:\n\n1) Apply constraints within each group of 3 inputs: in0..in2, in3..in5, ..., in27..in29.\n\nFor each triple (a,b,c):\n\n(<= a b), (<= a c), (<= b c)\n\n2) Apply constraints merging groups hierarchically similarly to N=29.\n\n3) The highest level root: in0 is \u2264 all at the next level groups.\n\nConstruct the explicit constraints for N=30, following the pattern exactly.\n\n---\n\nConstruct internal triple constraints for inputs:\n\nFor i in [0..9]:\n\n  group inputs: in[3i], in[3i+1], in[3i+2]\n\nAdd constraints:\n\n(<= in3i in3i+1)\n\n(<= in3i in3i+2)\n\n(<= in3i+1 in3i+2)\n\nAll triple constraints (10 triples total).\n\nNext, establish constraints between groups:\n\nFrom N=29, groups merge as:\n\n- Group0 \u2264 Group1\n\n- Group1 \u2264 Group2\n\n- ...\n\nMaintain the same linking pattern:\n\nFor each group i (0 to 8), constrain all members of group i \u2264 first member of group i+1.\n\ne.g.,\n\nFor group 0 (in0,in1,in2) \u2264 in3 (first of group1)\n\nSo add:\n\n(<= in0 in3)\n\n(<= in1 in3)\n\n(<= in2 in3)\n\nSimilarly for each adjacent group:\n\n(in3,in4,in5) \u2264 in6\n\n...\n\nContinue for all i in [0..8].\n\nSo 9 * 3 = 27 constraints.\n\nThen higher-level merges between these group leaders.\n\nWe need to form the pattern of merging groups.\n\nNext, from N=29, we see \"group leaders\" are constrained similarly:\n\nE.g., for group leaders in0,in3,in6,... these are again grouped in triples.\n\nWe can create a recursive hierarchical structure applied to group leaders, similar to how triples are constrained within themselves.\n\nApply the same triple pattern to the group leaders:\n\nGroup leaders at Level 1: in0, in3, in6, in9, in12, in15, in18, in21, in24, in27 (10 elements)\n\nGroup these into triples again:\n\nGroup 0 leaders: in0, in3, in6\n\nGroup 1 leaders: in9, in12, in15\n\nGroup 2 leaders: in18, in21, in24\n\nGroup 3 leaders: in27 alone with in28, in29? No, in29 is sibling in the last group.\n\nWait, in27 is last group leader at input level.\n\nOk, group leaders at level 1 are:\n\nin0, in3, in6, in9, in12, in15, in18, in21, in24, in27 (10 inputs)\n\nGroup these into triples as:\n\nGroup 0: in0, in3, in6\n\nGroup 1: in9, in12, in15\n\nGroup 2: in18, in21, in24\n\nGroup 3: in27 and ???\n\nNow, 10 inputs grouped into 3 groups of 3 + 1 extra.\n\nSo, incomplete triple at last.\n\nFor incomplete triples, guess the pattern is to constraint pairs as well as can be.\n\nFor group 3:\n\ninputs = in27, in28, in29\n\nBut in28 and in29 are not leaders at level 1, only group 0 leaders are above.\n\nA better method:\n\nAt each level:\n\n- First partition inputs into groups of 3.\n- For each group, apply full triple ordering\n- At next level, take the first element of each group as parent and apply the same constraints recursively.\n\nSo group leaders at level 1 are in0, in3, in6, in9, in12, in15, in18, in21, in24, in27\n\nTotal 10 elements.\n\nPartition at level 2:\n\nGroup 0: in0, in3, in6\n\nGroup 1: in9, in12, in15\n\nGroup 2: in18, in21, in24\n\nGroup 3: in27, ??? (in28? in29?)\n\nNo, in28, in29 belong to last group at level 0.\n\nSo final higher groups for leaders:\n\nGroup 3 consists of only in27\n\nLeaves in28, in29 as not leaders at level 1.\n\nWe might clue from the N=29 example that these are merged up per actual input and not all inputs are leaders at each level.\n\nPossibility:\n\nAt level 1 the last group has fewer than 3 elements. The pattern for smaller groups is similar but with missing elements.\n\nAlternatively, we observe that the major driver is the pattern of linking equal-sized triples of inputs recursively, where possible.\n\n---\n\nGiven the complexity and to follow the pattern exactly, we'll:\n\n- For each triple of inputs: (<=) all pairs in increasing chain\n\n- For each group i, for i in 0..8 (group0 to group8):\n\n  For elements in group i (in3i, in3i+1, in3i+2): link \u2264 first element in group i+1 (in3(i+1))\n\n- Then similarly, for the leaders:\n\n  For leaders at indices (0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27), apply the same pattern at higher level:\n\n  - Constrain leaders within triple groups:\n\n    for leaders 0,3,6:\n\n      (<= in0 in3), (<= in0 in6), (<= in3 in6)\n\n    for leaders 9,12,15:\n\n      etc.\n\n  - For merging these leader groups similarly as input groups:\n\n    leaders 0..6 \u2264 first leader of next group (leader 9 in this case), etc.\n\n- For leaders of groups covering indices beyond 27, we add constraints similarly until the root is reached.\n\n---\n\nTo summarize:\n\nWe will generate the constraints as:\n\n- For each triplet (inputs at indices 3i,3i+1,3i+2), add (<= a b), (<= a c), (<= b c)\n\n- For each i=0 to 8, add link constraints:\n\n  (<= in3i in3(i+1)), (<= in3i+1 in3(i+1)), (<= in3i+2 in3(i+1))\n\n- For each triplet of leaders at level 1, assign internal ordering constraints similarly:\n\n  triples: (in0, in3, in6), (in9, in12, in15), (in18, in21, in24) and handle grouping for rest (in27, in28, in29) accordingly.\n\n- For each triple of these leaders, add triple order constraints.\n\n- For merges between leader groups, link leaders similarly.\n\n- Finally, constrain in0 (highest root) to be \u2264 group leaders in next level.\n\n---\n\nWe can write this explicitly as a big conjunction.\n\nSince the input size is fixed and small (N=30), let's explicitly write all constraints.\n\n---\n\nStep 1: inside triples of inputs (10 groups):\n\nGroups and constraints:\n\nGroup0: in0, in1, in2\n (<= in0 in1) (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2)\n\nGroup1: in3, in4, in5\n (<= in3 in4) (<= in3 in5) (<= in4

The remaining indices seem to be increasing with gaps:\n\nFor N=22: 10,16,19,20,21  \nDistance from first index: +6, +9, +10, +11\n\nFor N=23: 11,17,20,21,22  \n+6, +9, +10, +11 again\n\nFor N=19: 9,14,16,17,18  \n+5, +7, +8, +9 (similar but smaller by one)\n\nFor N=16: 7,11,13,14,15  \n+4, +6, +7, +8\n\nFor N=13: 6,9,11,12  \n+3, +5, +6\n\nLook at the increments:\n\nFor N=30, let's predict similar spread with 5 indices.\n\nWe can assume the first index to be floor(N/2) - 1 = floor(15) - 1 = 14\n\nAnd the increments for the 4 next indices would be +6, +9, +10, +11 stated as in N=22 and 23.\n\nAdding these:\n\n14  \n14+6=20  \n14+9=23  \n14+10=24  \n14+11=25\n\nFive indices: 14, 20, 23, 24, 25 ; but 25 is less than N-1=29, so we need to include bigger indices.\n\nHowever, note that the last indices in other constraints always go up to N-1 (the highest index).\n\nFor N=22, last indices: 19,20,21 which is 21 = N-1\n\nSimilarly, for N=23, last indices 21,22 (N-1=22)\n\nFor N=16, last indices 14,15 (N-1=15)\n\nFor N=19, last indices 17,18 (N-1=18)\n\nSo the last few indices cluster at the end.\n\nThis suggests that the last indices in the constraint must include N-1 and the ones before it.\n\nGiven that, for N=30, last indices would be something like 27,28,29.\n\nSo probably the last indices are N-3, N-2, N-1 = 27,28,29\n\nNow we need to find the earlier indices.\n\nBased on the pattern for N=22:\n\nindices: 10,16,19,20,21  \nhere 19,20,21 are last three indices (N-3,N-2,N-1)\n\nSame for N=23:\n\n11,17,20,21,22  \n20,21,22 last three indices\n\nFor N=19:\n\n9,14,16,17,18  \n16,17,18 last three indices (N-3,N-2,N-1)\n\nFor N=16:\n\n7,11,13,14,15  \n13,14,15 last three indices\n\nSo first two indices vary, last three always N-3...N-1.\n\nThus for N=30, indices:\n\ni0, i1, 27, 28, 29\n\nWhere i0 < i1 < 27.\n\nLooking at first indices for N=22: 10,16  \nN=23: 11,17  \nN=19: 9,14  \nN=16:7,11\n\nNotice a pattern:\n\nFor N=22, difference between i0 and i1 is 6  \nFor N=23, difference 6  \nFor N=19, difference 5  \nFor N=16, difference 4\n\nFor N=30, difference could be around 8 (extrapolating or just picking from these).\n\nTry:\n\ni0 = 14  \ni1 = 22 (difference 8)\n\nAnd last three: 27,28,29\n\nSo indices: 14,22,27,28,29\n\nCheck ordering: 14 < 22 < 27 < 28 < 29 \u2713\n\nNow, for each index in the list, we have a block:\n\n(not (= inX t)) ( < inX t)\n\nwrapped in (and ... )\n\nFinally nested and nested and nested up to the total number of indices.\n\nThe final SMT-LIB assert statement is:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (not (= in14 t)) (< in14 t)) (not (= in22 t)) (< in22 t)) (not (= in27 t)) (< in27 t)) (not (= in28 t)) (< in28 t)) (not (= in29 t)) (< in29 t)))\n\nWe must create exact nesting with nested (and (and ... ) ... ) style matching the pattern.\n\nThere are 5 indices, so 5 (not ...)(< ... ) pairs nested as ANDs.\n\nThe nesting is left grouped as shown in examples, i.e.,\n\n(assert (and\n    (and\n      (and\n        (and\n          (not (= in14 t)) (< in14 t))\n          (not (= in22 t)) (< in22 t))\n          (not (= in27 t)) (< in27 t))\n          (not (= in28 t)) (< in28 t))\n          (not (= in29 t)) (< in29 t)))\n\nPerfect.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (not (= in14 t)) (< in14 t)) (not (= in22 t)) (< in22 t)) (not (= in27 t)) (< in27 t)) (not (= in28 t)) (< in28 t)) (not (= in29 t)) (< in29 t)))</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1242, "completion_tokens": 1801, "total_tokens": 3043, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_79b79be41f"}}, "error": null}

constraint: `( <= in0 in1 )`\n- For each constraint before it, wrap in `(and previous constraint new constraint)`\n\nSo iteratively nest:\n\n`and(... and (and ( <= in0 in1) ( <= in0 in2)) ...)`\n\nBut given the examples, the nesting order groups first all `( <= in i in N-1)` for i=0..N-2 in one `(and ...)`, then the `( <= in i in N-2)` for i=0..N-3 in the next `(and ...)`, etc.\n\nThat is, for each j descending from N-1 down to 1, collect `( <= in i in j)` for i=0..j-1, combine them with nested `(and ...)`s, then nest them with the previously constructed `(and ...)`s.\n\nLet's write a function pseudocode to generate this:\n\n- For j in [N-1 .. 1]:\n    - For i in [0 .. j-1]:\n        - constraint `( <= in i in j )`\n    - Combine the `( <= in i in j )` with nested `(and ...)`.\n\n- Then combine all these nested `(and ...)` per j into a big nested `(and ...)` from highest j to smallest.\n\nExample for N=4 for one j=3:\n\n`(and ( <= in0 in3) (and ( <= in1 in3) ( <= in2 in3)))`\n\nWe already see constraints for j=3 are combined similarly.\n\nSummary:\n\n- For each j from N-1 down to 1:\n    - Build a nested `(and ...)` for the list of `(<= in_i in_j)` for i=0..j-1\n- Then nest these big `(and ...)` layers together from highest j to lowest (j= N-1 downto 1)\n- Final wrap in `(assert (and ...))`\n\nTo code the nested `and` for list L:\n\n- If L has one element: return that element.\n- Else: `(and first (and second (and third ...)))` associating to the right.\n\nImplementing that strategy:\n\nStep 1: For each j in [N-1..1], build nested and of `(<= in i in j)` for i in 0..j-1\n\nStep 2: Combine all these per-j nested and expressions into a final deeply nested `(and ...)` from j=N-1 downto 1\n\nStep 3: wrap full expression in `(assert (and ...))`\n\nNote: The final `(assert (and ...))` includes a huge nested `(and ...)` with 171 constraints nested as per the pattern.\n\n---\n\nTo confirm, let's analyze the N=4 example from the prompt:\n\nN=4:\n\n```\n(assert (and \n  (and (and (and (and (and \n    ( <=  in0 in3)  ( <=  in1 in3))  ( <=  in2 in3))\n    ( <=  in0 in2))  ( <=  in1 in2))  \n    ( <=  in0 in1)))\n```\n\n- For j=3: `( <= in0 in3), ( <= in1 in3), ( <= in2 in3)` nested with `and`\n- For j=2: `( <= in0 in2), ( <= in1 in2)` nested with `and`\n- For j=1: `( <= in0 in1)` single term\n\nThen combined nested with `and` for j=3, j=2, j=1 (outermost `and`)\n\n---\n\nHence for N=19:\n\n- For j=18: constraints ( <= in0 in18) through ( <= in17 in18), nested with `and`\n- For j=17: constraints ( <= in0 in17) through ( <= in16 in17), nested with `and`\n- ...\n- For j=1: constraint ( <= in0 in1) single\n\nThen nested from j=18 down to j=1.\n\n---\n\nWe proceed to build this string step by step.\n\nBecause of the length, we won't show intermediate commentary inside the output, only digits and spaces, to follow the format required.\n\n---\n\nFinal formatting details:\n\n- Every constraint is `( <=  inI inJ)` with two spaces after opening and before closing parenthesis, as in the examples.\n\n- The nested `and` format is `(and expr1 expr2)` with a space after `and`.\n\n- The top level is `(assert (and ...))`\n\n---\n\nLet's

(and ... constraint1 constraint2)... ) constraintN constraintN+1)\n\nIn the example for N=5, total pairs = 10 pairs * 2 = 20 constraints, I can see how it is nested.\n\nThe nesting is left-associative, always (and left right), and right is a constraint or (and ...) for the next constraints.\n\nTo generate the code:\n\n- Generate all pairs of constraints for i in 1..15, j in 0..i-1: in order ( >= in_i in_j ), ( > in_i in_j )\n\n- Flatten the pairs into sequence\n\n- Build nested (and ...) with all constraints, left to right.\n\nFinally, wrap with (assert (and ...)) \n\nNote that the spacing and formatting exactly matches the example, i.e., space between tokens.\n\nFor instance, the example shows (assert (and (and ... (and (and ( >= in1 in0) ( > in1 in0)) ... ))))\n\nWe will replicate the same style:\n\n- All constraints and nested and's separated by spaces\n\n- The \"and\" are nested in individual pairs of parentheses, building up the chain.\n\n- We do not add extra whitespace or comments.\n\nLet's write out the constraints as tokens first:\n\nGenerate list constraint pairs:\n\nfor i in 1..15:\n  for j in 0..(i-1):\n    add (>= in{i} in{j})\n    add (> in{i} in{j})\n\nTotal constraints = 240\n\nWrap groups of two constraints with (and constraint1 constraint2)\n\nThen nest all such (and ...) clauses into a chain of (and ...) clauses left-associative.\n\nIn SMT-LIB, (and c1 c2 c3 ...) is acceptable as n-ary, but here in the examples, they use nested binary ands.\n\nTherefore, we must construct nested (and (and (...)) ...) expressions so that each (and ...) has exactly two operands, or could be a chain. But from the examples, it seems each (and ...) has exactly two children always:\n\nChecking the example for N=2:\n\n(assert (and  ( >=  in1 in0)  ( >  in1 in0)))\n\nHere the and has two children.\n\nFor N=3:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and  ( >=  in1 in0)  ( >  in1 in0))  \n( >=  in2 in0))  ( >  in2 in0))  ( >=  in2 in1))  ( >  in2 in1)))\n\nHere the nesting is:\n\n(assert (and \n   (and \n       (and \n           (and \n               (and ( >= in1 in0) ( > in1 in0)) \n               ( >= in2 in0)) \n           ( > in2 in0)) \n       ( >= in2 in1)) \n   ( > in2 in1)\n))\n\nSo with constraints c1, c2, c3,..., c6, the structure is:\n\n(and (and (and (and (and c1 c2) c3) c4) c5) c6)\n\nThis means the constraints are nested as a \"left fold\" of (and a b) where b is a constraint.\n\nSimilarly for higher N.\n\nTherefore, build (and (and (and ... (and (and c1 c2) c3) ...) cN)\n\nThis is like left fold with start (and c1 c2), then take result (and result c3), take that result and (and result c4), etc.\n\nSo starting from first two constraints c1 and c2 wrapped with (and c1 c2), then for each further constraint ci, nest (and previous ci).\n\nHence total constraints = M even (240 here).\n\nSo constraints: c1, c2, ..., cM\n\nBut first combined c1 and c2 as (and c1 c2)\n\nthen (and (and c1 c2) c3)\n\nthen (and (and (and c1 c2) c3) c4) and so on.\n\nAt the end, wrap the whole chain inside (assert (and ...))\n\nSo finally:\n\n(assert <nested_and_chain>)\n\nwhere nested_and_chain is constructed as described.\n\nThis matches the examples exactly.\n\nNow translate this to SMT-LIB tokens with spaces as in examples:\n\n- The <= and > symbols are inside parentheses, e.g. ( >=  in1 in0)\n\n- Each constraint has spaces, e.g. ( >=  in1 in0), with two spaces after >= in examples.\n\nI will keep the spacing consistent as one space after operator, two spaces before variable names to match example.\n\nExamples have spaces as:\n\n( >=  in1 in0)\n\nSo we will output exactly as ( >=  in1 in0), ( >  in1 in0)\n\nNote two spaces after operator, then variable names separated by space, no extra spaces inside parentheses.\n\nNow for in16 (which is index 15 since 0-based):\n\nVariables in0 through in15.\n\nGenerate constraints for i in 1..15:\n\n    for j in 0..i-1:\n\n        ( >=  in{i} in{j})\n\n        ( >  in{i} in{j})\n\nTotal 240 constraints.\n\nNest the constraints in left fold style:\n\nL = constraints list c1..c240\n\nNested expression:\n\nres = (and c1 c2)\n\nfor ci in c3..c240:\n\n    res = (and res ci)\n\nthen final:\n\n(assert res)\n\nSo now, produce exact string following this

i we add (<= in_i in_{i-1}) and (< in_i in_{i-1}), nested as a chain of 'and's.\n\nSo for i in 1..10:\n\nWe generate in order:\n\n(<= in1 in0), (< in1 in0), (<= in2 in1), (< in2 in1), ..., (<= in10

(<= ch4 90)))\n\nTherefore, the pattern is that the entire prior expression is nested with two (and)s for each extra variable.\n\nSo each new variable adds two 'and' nestings wrapping the previous expression plus that variable's triplet constraints.\n\nFrom the examples:\n\nFor N=1:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (< ch0 97) (>= ch0 65)) (<= ch0 90)))\n\nThen for N=2:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (< ch0 97) (>= ch0 65)) (<= ch0 90)) (< ch1 97)) (>= ch1 65)) (<= ch1 90)))\n\nand so on.\n\nThis is consistent with each additional variable adding a block of (and (and ... ) ... ) wrapping previous.\n\nTherefore we will programmatically build:\n\nstart = (and (and (< ch0 97) (>= ch0 65)) (<= ch0 90))\n\nThen for i=1 to 14:\n\nstart = (and (and start (< chi 97)) (>= chi 65)) then wrap again (and start (<= chi 90))\n\nBut from the examples, it's done as:\n\nstart = (and (and start (< chi 97)) (>= chi 65)) then\n\nstart = (and start (<= chi 90))\n\nTherefore, for each i>0:\n\nstart = (and (and start (< chi 97)) (>= chi 65))\n\nstart = (and start (<= chi 90))\n\nWe do this repeatedly from 1 to 14.\n\nThus, in the final, we will have a single assert wrapping that nested 'and's chain.\n\n\nLet me build the final for N=15 accordingly.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (< ch0 97) (>= ch0 65)) (<= ch0 90)) (< ch1 97)) (>= ch1 65)) (<= ch1 90)) (< ch2 97)) (>= ch2 65)) (<= ch2 90)) (< ch3 97)) (>= ch3 65)) (<= ch3 90)) (< ch4 97)) (>= ch4 65)) (<= ch4 90)) (< ch5 97)) (>= ch5 65)) (<= ch5 90)) (< ch6 97)) (>= ch6 65)) (<= ch6 90)) (< ch7 97)) (>= ch7 65)) (<= ch7 90)) (< ch8 97)) (>= ch8 65)) (<= ch8 90)) (< ch9 97)) (>= ch9 65)) (<= ch9 90)) (< ch10 97)) (>= ch10 65)) (<= ch10 90)) (< ch11 97)) (>= ch11 65)) (<= ch11 90)) (< ch12 97)) (>= ch12 65)) (<= ch12 90)) (< ch13 97)) (>= ch13 65)) (<= ch13 90)) (< ch14 97)) (>= ch14 65)) (<= ch14 90)))</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 901, "completion_tokens": 1999, "total_tokens": 2900, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_79b79be41f"}}, "error": null}

For each pair of variables in_i and in_j where i < j:\n   - Include both `(>= in_i in_j)` and `(> in_i in_j)`.\n2. For each variable in_i, include:\n   - `(not (= in_i in))`\n   - `(>= in_i in)`\n\nThe results for N=9 and N=12 clearly show that the pairwise relations are listed for all distinct i<j pairs. For N=19, we will have pairs (in_i, in_j) for all 0 <= i < j <= 18, each with two conditions `(>= in_i in_j)` and `(> in_i in_j)`.\n\nThen, for each i in 0..18, append `(not (= in_i in))` and `(>= in_i in)`.\n\nAll must be wrapped in a single top-level `(assert (and ...))` clause.\n\nThese are the steps to construct the SMT-LIB string:\n\n- Generate all pairs i<j in [0..18].\n- For each pair output `(>= in_i in_j)` and `(> in_i in_j)`.\n- For each i output `(not (= in_i in))` and `(>= in_i in)`.\n- Wrap all of those expressions in `(assert (and ...))`.\n- Join them with spaces, no extra commentary.\n\nNote: the examples show heavy nesting with many `(and ... )` clauses internally wrapping pairs. But the instruction is \"All per-variable constraints must be combined using a top-level (assert (and ...)) clause\". So the output should place all constraints flatly inside the top-level `and`, no nested `and`.\n\nWe must output canonical SMT-LIB format exactly, just like the examples.\n\nTherefore, the output structure is:\n\n(assert (and\n   [for all 0<=i<j<19: (>= in_i in_j) ( > in_i in_j )]\n   [for all i in 0..18: (not (= in_i in)) (>= in_i in)]\n))\n\nI will write this out now.\n\nNumber of pairs = (19*18)/2 = 171 pairs, each pair contributes 2 constraints = 342 constraints.\n\nPlus 19 * 2 = 38 constraints for individual variables.\n\nTotal constraints = 342 + 38 = 380 constraints overall.\n\nNow to generate the string.\n\nNote: In the examples the spacing is like `( >=  in0 in1)` i.e., a single space between tokens, but double spaces after `(` for the operator.\n\nBut looking closely, it's consistent that after an open bracket `(`, operator is prefixed with one space then operator name and parameters separated by spaces, with possibly extra spaces.\n\nBetween tokens there is always a single space, however after `( ` there is double spacing.\n\nIn the example in N=9:\n\n `(>=  in0 in1)`\n\nI see `(>=  in0 in1)` with two spaces after `(`. I will replicate that exactly: open paren, then two spaces, then operator name, single space, then parameters.\n\nSimilarly for `( >  in0 in1)`, `(not ( = in0 in))`, `(>=  in0 in)` each follow:\n\n- opening `(`, two spaces.\n- operator name.\n- single space separated tokens.\n- For `(not ( = in0 in))`, the inner `=` uses `( = in0 in)`, that is opening `(=`, one space after paren, then operator `=`, then tokens, closed and wrapped inside the `(not ...)`.\n\nHence special format for `(not (= ...))` is `(not ( = in_i in))`.\n\nTo be consistent, it's `(not ( = in0 in))` with one space after `(` before `=` operator.\n\nSo we have to replicate the format exactly.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- For `>=` and `>`, the format: `(>=  in_i in_j)` and `(>  in_i in_j)`\n- For `(not (= in_i in))`: `(not ( = in_i in))`\n- For `(>= in_i in)`: `(>=  in_i in)`\n\nWe'll replicate these exactly.\n\nNow I will assemble the whole string with `(assert (and ...))` and put all constraints separated by spaces.\n\nTo save space, I will order:\n\n- First all pairwise constraints (for 0 <= i < j < 19), with `(>=  in_i in_j)` then `(>  in_i in_j)`\n- Then all variable constraints `(not ( = in_i in))` and `(>=  in_i

in19..21:\n\n( <=  in19 in20)\n( <=  in19 in21)\n( <=  in20 in21)\n\nThen merging these two triples:\n\n( <=  in17 in19)\n( <=  in16 in19)\n( <=  in16 in20), etc.\n\nThen merge for the whole B4 block:\n\nA reasonable pattern:\n\n( <=  in16 in19)\n( <=  in16 in20)\n( <=  in17 in19)\n( <=  in17 in20)\n( <=  in18 in19)\n( <=  in18 in20)\n( <=  in18 in21)\n( <=  in17 in21)\n( <=  in16 in21)\n\nThen merge constraints between blocks:\n\n- B0 with B1:\n\n( <=  in4 in6)\n( <=  in0 in4)\n( <=  in1 in4)\n( <=  in2 in4)\n( <=  in3 in4)\n\n- B1 with B2:\n\n( <=  in8 in10)\n( <=  in4 in8)\n( <=  in5 in8)\n( <=  in6 in8)\n( <=  in7 in8)\n\n- B2 with B3:\n\n( <=  in12 in14)\n( <=  in8 in12)\n( <=  in9 in12)\n( <=  in10 in12)\n( <=  in11 in12)\n\n- Merge B0..B3 into a sorted block of 16 elements by forming the constraints similar to N=16 example:\n\nThen merge B0..B3 combined (in0..15 sorted) with B4 (in16..21 sorted):\n\n- For merge of (0..15) with (16..21):\n\n( <=  in16 in18) done above internally\n\nWe add merging constraints among these:\n\n( <=  in0 in16)\n( <=  in1 in16)\n( <=  in2 in16)\n( <=  in3 in16)\n...\n( <=  in15 in16)\n\n( <=  in16 in17)\n( <=  in17 in18)\n( <=  in18 in19)\n...\n\nBut only constraints explicitly connecting the two halves are needed, as in previous examples.\n\nSummary:\n- This problem is very complex to write fully by hand.\n- We must replicate the style seen in examples, forming a top-level (assert (and ...)) with the nested (and ...) structure, but problem specifies all constraints at top level combined into a single (assert (and ...)), no extra commentary.\n\nTherefore, the answer will be a big (assert (and ...)) with all required ( <= inX inY) statements grouped via (and ...).\n\nWe can also observe from examples that the nested ands eventually reduce to a single big conjunction of ( <= inX inY) constraints.\n\nSo for final output, all constraints can be in a single (assert (and ... all constraints ...)) without intermediate nested ands.\n\nI will write out explicitly the constraints for N=22 in canonical SMT-LIB format matching the style.\n\nApproach:\n\n- Build constraints on each 4-element block (in0..3, in4..7, in8..11, in12..15) like N=8 example\n- Build constraints on 6-element block (in16..21), breaking to two blocks of 3 elements, as from N=3 example, then merging those two blocks\n- Add merging constraints between blocks as mergesort merges\n\nLet's encode:\n\nBlock order:\n\nB0 (0..3): \n (<= in0 in1), (<= in2 in3), (<= in0 in2), (<= in1 in2)\n\nB1 (4..7): similar: (<= in4 in5), (<= in6

(<= in4 in8), (<= in5 in8), (<= in6 in8), (<= in7 in8)\n\nFinally merge B0..B3 with B4:\n(<= in16 in18), (<= in0 in16), (<= in1 in16), (<= in2 in16), (<= in3 in16), (<= in4 in16), (<= in5 in16), (<=

(< ...))` are combined pairwise nested using `(and ...)` again, making a deep nested structure.\n\nSo for general N:\n- For i in 1..N-1:\n  ` (and (<= in{i} in{i-1}) (< in{i} in{i-1}))`\n\n- Then nested as:\n  `(and (and (and ...

(<= inN-1 inN-2)) (< inN-1 inN-2)))\n\nMore specifically, they group two pairs at each `and`, so their basic leaf pair is `(and (<= in{i} in{i-1}) (< in{i} in{i-1}))`, then pairs of these are combined at next level with another `and`.\n\nBut examples from N=9 or N=14 show that each new `(and)` nests inside the previous one without combining pairs differently.\n\nLooking carefully at N=9 example:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and\n\nNine `and` keywords, with pairs inside.\n\nActually, for N=9, there are 8 such pairs, so the number of `and` operators is 17 (because each pair has an `and`, and each nesting level is also an `and`).\n\nCounting the `and` occurrences in the N=9 example:\n\n`(assert (and (and ...  (and (and   (and (<= in1 in0) (< in1 in0)) (<= in2 in1)) (< in2 in1)) ...)`\n\nWe can observe that their structure is:\n\n(assert (and  (and (... (and  (and (and (<= in1 in0) (< in1 in0)) (<= in2 in1)) (< in2 in1)) ...)\n\nMeaning the pair `(<= in1 in0) (< in1 in0)` is wrapped inside `(and ...)`, then combined with `(<= in2 in1), (< in2 in1)` each wrapped with `and`s recursively.\n\nSo the exact nesting pattern is: (and (and (and ... (and (and (and (and (<= in1 in0) (< in1 in0)) (<= in2 in1)) (< in2 in1)) ... ))\n\nHence for each pair i, we have `(and (<= in{i} in{i-1}) (< in{i} in{i-1}))`.\n\nThen that pair is combined with the `(and ... nested ...)` representing the next i+1 pairs.\n\nSo recursively for i from 1 to N-1:\n\nF(i) = `(and (and (<= in{i} in{i-1}) (< in{i} in{i-1})) F(i+1))`\n\nwith base case at i=N-1: last pair `(and (<= in{N-1} in{N-2}) (< in{N-1} in{N-2}))`\n\nThis matches the examples.\n\nSo for N=25:\n\nWe need to create such nested `(and (and (<= in1 in0) (< in1 in0)) (and (and (<= in2 in1) (< in2 in1)) (and (and (<= in3 in2) (< in3 in2)) ... )))`\n\nuntil the last term `(and (<= in24 in23) (< in24 in23))`\n\nFinally wrap that in `(assert (and ...))`\n\nSince the outermost `(assert (and ...))` wraps the top-level `and` expression.\n\nTherefore the complete expression is:\n\n(assert (and\n  (and\n    (<= in1 in0)\n    (< in1 in0)\n  )\n  (and\n    (and\n      (<= in2 in1)\n      (< in2 in1)\n    )\n    (and\n      (and\n        (<= in3 in2)\n        (< in3 in2)\n      )\n      ...\n    )\n  )\n))\n\nrepeated, with each pair nested to the right side inside `(and ...)`.\n\nThe number of `(and` tokens at the start corresponds to the number of pairs nested.\n\nFor N=25, 24 pairs; so 24 nesting.\n\nHence final SMT-LIB format expression with correct nesting of `and` operators, no extra comments or spaces outside the pattern observed.\n\nWe proceed to generate it.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  (<= in1 in0)  (< in1 in0))  (and (<= in2 in1)  (< in2 in1))) (and (<= in3 in2)  (< in3 in2))) (and (<= in4 in3)  (< in4 in3))) (and (<= in5 in4)  (< in5 in4))) (and (<= in6 in5)  (< in6 in5))) (and (<= in7 in6)  (< in7 in6))) (and (<= in8 in7)  (< in8 in7))) (and (<= in9 in8)  (< in9 in8))) (and (<= in10 in9)  (< in10 in9))) (and (<= in11 in10)  (< in11 in10))) (and (<= in12 in11)  (< in12 in11))) (and (<= in13 in12)  (< in13 in12))) (and (<= in14 in13)  (< in14 in13))) (and (<= in15 in14)  (< in15 in14))) (and (<= in16 in15)  (< in16 in15))) (and (<= in17 in16)  (< in17 in16))) (and (<= in18 in17)  (< in18 in17))) (and (<= in19 in18)  (< in19 in18))) (and (<= in20 in19)  (< in20 in19))) (and (<= in21 in20)  (< in21 in20))) (and (<= in22 in21)  (< in22 in21))) (and (<= in23 in22)  (< in23 in22))) (and (<= in24 in23)  (< in24 in23)))))\n</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1992, "completion_tokens": 1786, "total_tokens": 3778, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

These are then nested in \"and\" clauses all combined with a top-level (assert (and ...)) expression.\n\nWe have to carefully nest the \"and\"s to exactly follow the pattern of the examples.\n\nFrom the examples, it's always nesting: for each pair, an (and (>= ...) (>) ... ) is formed, then nested with the next pair's (and ...), all the way to form a single deeply nested \"and\" structure.\n\nNumber of pairs: for N=12, pairs (i,j) with i from 1 to 11 and j < i:\n\nSum i=1 to 11 of i = (11*12)/2 = 66 pairs.\n\nEach pair corresponds to two constraints: (>=) and (>).\n\nTherefore, total 66 pairs each with two constraints grouped by \"and\", and those 66 \"and\"s nested inside another \"and\" forming a big nested structure.\n\nThe nesting pattern is a big chain of nested (and ... ...), where each branch is an (and (>= ...) (> ...)) clause.\n\nThe examples literally nest pairs one inside another, taking care to maintain order.\n\nTherefore, the output for N=12 is:\n\n(assert (and <nested pairs>))\n\nThe first pair is (i=1,j=0), output (and (>= in1 in0) (> in1 in0))\n\nThen nested with the next pair (i=2,j=0), then (i=2,j=1), etc. in order of i increasing, and for each i, j increasing from 0 to i-1.\n\nThe nesting is left-associative: the first (and ...) pair is nested inside the next (and ...), and so on.\n\nHence the output is:\n\n(assert (and <pair1> <pair2> ... <pair66>))\n\nHowever, from the examples for N=3,5,6, the nested \"and\" is deeply nested in a left-associative way:\n\n(assert (and (and (and ... (and (and (and ...)))\n\nMeaning, for example for first two pairs A and B:\n\n(assert (and A B))\n\nFor three pairs A, B, C:\n\n(assert (and (and A B) C))\n\nFor 4 pairs:\n\n(assert (and (and (and A B) C) D))\n\nand so on.\n\nSo for 66 pairs, the nesting will be:\n\n(assert (and (and (and ... (and pair1 pair2) pair3) ... ) pair66))\n\nTo produce this, we can:\n\n- Start with last pair as expression\n\n- For each pair in reversed order from pair66 to pair1, wrap with (and current pair accumulated)\n\n- Finally, wrap with (assert (and ...))\n\nNow proceed to generate the string.\n\nWe generate all pairs (i,j) with i=1..11, j=0..i-1\n\nFor each, create (and (>= in{i} in{j}) (> in{i} in{j}))\n\nCollect these in order in a list: pair1 = (i=1,j=0), pair2 = (i=2,j=0), pair3 = (i=2,j=1) ...\n\nThen perform left-associative nesting using (and ... ...)\n\nFor example with pairs p1,p2,p3:\n\n(and (and p1 p2) p3)\n\nFor 66 pairs, the nesting is:\n\n(and (... (and (and p1 p2) p3) ...) p66)\n\nFinally wrap with (assert (and ...))\n\nNow actually generate this in SMTLIB syntax.\n\nTo make the output concise:\n\nEach (and (>= in{i} in{j}) (> in{i} in{j})) for the pair needs to be parenthesized properly.\n\nSo every pair is:\n\n(and (>= in{i} in{j}) (> in{i} in{j}))\n\nThen the left-associative nesting combines these pairs.\n\nThus for the first two pairs p1 and p2:\n\n(and p1 p2) -> (and (and (>= in1 in0) (> in1 in0)) (and (>= in2 in0) (> in2 in0)))\n\nThen add p3:\n\n(and (and p1 p2) p3)\n\nand so on...\n\nThe final output is the deeply nested (assert (and ...)) structure.\n\nRequirement: output exactly in canonical SMT-LIB format without extra commentary.\n\nTherefore, I will generate the final string accordingly.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  (>=  in1 in0)  (>  in1 in0))  (and  (>=  in2 in0)  (>  in2 in0)))  (and  (>=  in2 in1)  (>  in2 in1))))  (and  (>=  in3 in0)  (>  in3 in0)))  (and  (>=  in3 in1)  (>  in3 in1))))  (and  (>=  in3 in2)  (>  in3 in2))))  (and  (>=  in4 in0)  (>  in4 in0)))  (and  (>=  in4 in1)  (>  in4 in1))))  (and  (>=  in4 in2)  (>  in4 in2))))  (and  (>=  in4 in3)  (>  in4 in3))))  (and  (>=  in5 in0)  (>  in5 in0)))  (and  (>=  in5 in1)  (>  in5 in1))))  (and  (>=  in5 in2)  (>  in5 in2))))  (and  (>=  in5 in3)  (>  in5 in3))))  (and  (>=  in5 in4)  (>  in5 in4))))  (and  (>=  in6 in0)  (>  in6 in0)))  (and  (>=  in6 in1)  (>  in6 in1))))  (and  (>=  in6 in2)  (>  in6 in2))))  (and  (>=  in6 in3)  (>  in6 in3))))  (and  (>=  in6 in4)  (>  in6 in4))))  (and  (>=  in6 in5)  (>  in6 in5))))  (and  (>=  in7 in0)  (>  in7 in0)))  (and  (>=  in7 in1)  (>  in7 in1))))  (and  (>=  in7 in2)  (>  in7 in2))))  (and  (>=  in7 in3)  (>  in7 in3))))  (and  (>=  in7 in4)  (>  in7 in4))))  (and  (>=  in7 in5)  (>  in7 in5))))  (and  (>=  in7 in6)  (>  in7 in6))))  (and  (>=  in8 in0)  (>  in8 in0)))  (and  (>=  in8 in1)  (>  in8 in1))))  (and  (>=  in8 in2)  (>  in8 in2))))  (and  (>=  in8 in3)  (>  in8 in3))))  (and  (>=  in8 in4)  (>  in8 in4))))  (and  (>=  in8 in5)  (>  in8 in5))))  (and  (>=  in8 in6)  (>  in8 in6))))  (and  (>=  in8 in7)  (>  in8 in7))))  (and  (>=  in9 in0)  (>  in9 in0)))  (and  (>=  in9 in1)  (>  in9 in1))))  (and  (>=  in9 in2)  (>  in9 in2))))  (and  (>=  in9 in3)  (>  in9 in3))))  (and  (>=  in9 in4)  (>  in9 in4))))  (and  (>=  in9 in5)  (>  in9 in5))))  (and  (>=  in9 in6)  (>  in9 in6))))  (and  (>=  in9 in7)  (>  in9 in7))))  (and  (>=  in9 in8)  (>  in9 in8))))  (and  (>=  in10 in0)  (>  in10 in0)))  (and  (>=  in10 in1)  (>  in10 in1))))  (and  (>=  in10 in2)  (>  in10 in2))))  (and  (>=  in10 in3)  (>  in10 in3))))  (and  (>=  in10 in4)  (>  in10 in4))))  (and  (>=  in10 in5)  (>  in10 in5))))  (and  (>=  in10 in6)  (>  in10 in6))))  (and  (>=  in10 in7)  (>  in10 in7))))  (and  (>=  in10 in8)  (>  in10 in8))))  (and  (>=  in10 in9)  (>  in10 in9))))  (and  (>=  in11 in0)  (>  in11 in0)))  (and  (>=  in11 in1)  (>  in11 in1))))  (and  (>=  in11 in2)  (>  in11 in2))))  (and  (>=  in11 in3)  (>  in11 in3))))  (and  (>=  in11 in4)  (>  in11 in4))))  (and  (>=  in11 in5)  (>  in11 in5))))  (and  (>=  in11 in6)  (>  in11 in6))))  (and  (>=  in11 in7)  (>  in11 in7))))  (and  (>=  in11 in8)  (>  in11 in8))))  (and  (>=  in11 in9)  (>  in11 in9))))  (and  (>=  in11 in10)  (>  in11 in10)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 754, "completion_tokens": 2717, "total_tokens": 3471, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

(and ... ) ... ) pairs.\n\nFor N=19, the variables are in0 to in18.\n\nNumber of pairs = C(19,2) = 19*18/2 = 171 pairs.\n\nEach pair (i,j) such that 0 <= i < j < 19 contributes ( > in{i} in{j} ).\n\nThe constraint is:\n(assert (and (and (and ...

nesting:\n\n(and (prev-and) ( > in0 in4)) \n\nuntil we finish all pairs starting with in0.\n\nThen proceed to pairs starting with in1:\n\n(and (prev-and) ( > in1 in2))\n\nuntil all pairs done.\n\nThis matches the parenthesis structure in the examples.\n\nHence, the canonical form is a nested (and ... ) of all pairs of (> in{i} in{j})\n\nThis is what will be output.\n\nNo extra spacing, just spaces

The tree is built bottom-up, forming balanced merges; constraints are nested (and (and ...)).\n\nWe will reconstruct the constraints by following the pattern:\n\n- Partition the array into two halves, left and right.\n- Constrain within the left half recursively.\n- Constrain within the right half recursively.\n- Constrain merges between halves.\n\nObserve from examples:\n- In leaves with 2 elements `[i, j]`: constrain (<= in_i in_j)\n- For merges of two segments L and R, constraints are:\n  - All ordering constraints inside L\n  - All ordering constraints inside R\n  - For every i in L, j in R, condition (<= in_i in_j) for merge.\n\nTo avoid exponential increase, the example merges add the minimal set of comparisons to ensure merging, mostly comparing to the bounds of the halves or intermediate range.\n\nLook at example N=19: It divides into:\n- Left: 0..4 (length 5)\n- 5..9 (length 5)\n- 10..15 (length 6)\n- 15..18 (length 4)\n\nAnd recursively merges smaller.\n\nThus we will:\n\nStep 1: For N=25, the largest power-of-2 less than 25 is 16, so split into:\n\n- Left part: indices 0..15 (16 elements)\n- Right part: indices 16..24 (9 elements)\n\nRecursively construct constraints for each half, then add merge constraints between halves.\n\nStep 2: For left half 0..15 (N=16), constraints follow example of N=15 (closest) plus index 15 added.\n\nBy analogy with N=15 pattern, and extending one more element:\n\nFrom N=15 constraints, we have 3 groups of size 4: 0..3, 4..7, 8..11 and 12..14 for last quarter.\n\nAdd merges accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, for right half 16..24 (N=9), constraints similar to N=9 but indices shifted by 16.\n\nFinally, add merges between these halves (0..15) and (16..24):\n\nEvery element in (0..15) \u2264 every element in (16..24), but examples show more minimal merges:\n\nActually, the merges add constraints comparing the \"boundary\" elements of left half and right half and some intermediate.\n\nThrough examining given examples, the final SMT-LIB string is formed by nested (and ...), combining all partial constraints.\n\nTo better proceed, let's build up the constraints per half by pasting the known templates shifted:\n\n- For N=16: it's like N=15 plus one more element (15).\nThe pattern for N=15 is given.\nFor N=16, add element in15 and merge constraints involving in15 within last merges.\n\n- For right half N=9 with indices 16..24: use the N=9 sample shifted by 16.\n\nThen merge the two halves: add constraints comparing all elements in left half to elements in right half in minimal ways, i.e., as in the existing examples.\n\nFinally combine everything in one top-level (assert (and ...)) with no extra wrapper (no nested ands outside).\n\nThe final formula is a fully nested (and ...) structure with all these components.\n\nNote: Because the exact nested structure is heavy, we follow the rules to nest (and ...) from left to right combining each pair of constraints, matching the example style.\n\nTo minimize errors, I will write the constraints without extra commentary and use the pattern of inequality constraints from examples, carefully following index ranges and merges.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Left half 0..15**\n\nLet's write constraints for N=16 (indices 0 to 15), replying to N=15 closely, but adding last extra element in15.\n\nFrom N=15 example, the constraints are (for in0..in7, in8..in14):\n\n- (<= in0 in1), (<= in2 in3)\n\n- (<= in0 in2), (<= in1 in2)\n\n- (<= in4 in5), (<= in6 in7)\n\n- (<= in4 in6), (<= in5 in6)\n\n- (<= in0 in4), (<= in1 in4), (<= in2 in4), (<= in3 in4)\n\n- (<= in8 in9), (<= in10 in11)\n\n- (<= in8 in10), (<= in9 in10)\n\n- (<= in12 in13), (<= in12 in14), (<= in13 in14)\n\n- (<= in8 in12), (<= in9 in12), (<= in10 in12), (<= in11 in12)\n\n- (<= in0 in8), (<= in1 in8), ..., (<= in7 in8)\n\nFrom this, for N=16 add in15.\n\nIt connects to in12..in14 in the last merge; now that segment has 4 elements for merges: 12..15.\n\nSo we expect:\n\n- (<= in13 in15), (<= in14 in15)\n\n- (<= in12 in15)\n\n- (<= in8 in13), (<= in9 in13), (<= in10 in13), (<= in11 in13), (<= in8 in14), etc.\n\nBut the examples do not explicitly detail this for N=16, so we extend the last merges adding constraints for in15.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Right half 16..24 (N=9)**\n\nUse the N=9 example shifted by 16:\n\nFor N=9 example: \n( <= in0 in1) (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2) (<= in3 in4) (<= in0 in3) (<= in1 in3) (<= in2 in3) (<= in5 in6) (<= in7 in8) (<= in5 in7) (<= in6 in7) (<= in0 in5) (<= in1 in5) (<= in2 in5) (<= in3 in5) (<= in4 in5)\n\nIndices shifted by +16:\n\n(<= in16 in17) (<= in16 in18) (<= in17 in18) (<= in19 in20) (<= in16 in19) (<= in17 in19) (<= in18 in19) (<= in21 in22) (<= in23 in24) (<= in21 in23) (<= in22 in23) (<= in16 in21) (<= in17 in21) (<= in18 in21) (<= in19 in21) (<= in20 in21)\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Merge between left half (0..15) and right half (16..24):**\n\nFrom previous examples, merges between halves are encoded as all elements of left half always \u2264 the first element of right half or some minimal set ensuring sorted order.\n\nTo keep minimal but safe, add at least:\n\n(<= in0 in16)\n\n(<= in1 in16)\n\n...\n\n(<= in15 in16)\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Put everything together inside a single top-level (assert (and ...)) combining by nested (and (and ...)) style shown in examples.\n\n---\n\nFinal plan:\n\n- Use nested (and ...) combining each condition left to right.\n\n- First combine left half constraints, then right half constraints, then the merge constraints.\n\n---\n\nNow constructing the final string...\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  ( <=  in0 in1)  ( <=  in2 in3))  ( <=  in0 in2))  ( <=  in1 in2))  ( <=  in4 in5))  ( <=  in6 in7))  ( <=  in4 in6))  ( <=  in5 in6))  ( <=  in0 in4))  ( <=  in1 in4))  ( <=  in2 in4))  ( <=  in3 in4))  ( <=  in8 in9))  ( <=  in10 in11))  ( <=  in8 in10))  ( <=  in9 in10))  ( <=  in12 in13))  ( <=  in13 in14))  ( <=  in12 in15))  ( <=  in13 in15))  ( <=  in14 in15))  ( <=  in8 in12))  ( <=  in9 in12))  ( <=  in10 in12))  ( <=  in11 in12))  ( <=  in0 in8))  ( <=  in1 in8))  ( <=  in2 in8))  ( <=  in3 in8))  ( <=  in4 in8))  ( <=  in5 in8))  ( <=  in6 in8))  ( <=  in7 in8)))  (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  ( <=  in16 in17)  ( <=  in16 in18))  ( <=  in17 in18))  ( <=  in19 in20))  ( <=  in16 in19))  ( <=  in17 in19))  ( <=  in18 in19))  ( <=  in21 in22))  ( <=  in23 in24))  ( <=  in21 in23))  ( <=  in22 in23))  ( <=  in16 in21))  ( <=  in17 in21))  ( <=  in18 in21))  ( <=  in19 in21))  ( <=  in20 in21))))  (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  ( <=  in0 in16)  ( <=  in1 in16))  ( <=  in2 in16))  ( <=  in3 in16))  ( <=  in4 in16))  ( <=  in5 in16))  ( <=  in6 in16))  ( <=  in7 in16))  ( <=  in8 in16))  ( <=  in9 in16))  ( <=  in10 in16))  ( <=  in11 in16))  ( <=  in12 in16))  ( <=  in13 in16))  ( <=  in14 in16))  ( <=  in15 in16)))))</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2168, "completion_tokens": 2475, "total_tokens": 4643, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

(ch18 constraints))\n\nWe need 56 nested 'and's between constraints because:\n\nNumber of constraints = 57\n\nNumber of nested 'and's = constraints - 1 = 56\n\nEach variable's constraints are grouped as:\n\nFor variable i:\n\n  (and (and ( <  ch{i} 97)  ( >=  ch{i} 65))  ( <=  ch{i} 90))\n\nThis counts as two 'and's deep inside per variable.\n\nThese per-variable constraints are then combined with nested 'and' to form the full expression.\n\nWe need a total nesting of 'and' joining the 19 groups, resulting in (19 - 1) = 18 top-level nested 'and's plus the internal per-variable 'and's.\n\nBut from the examples, it's always one big nested 'and' joining all constraints individually, i.e., flatten all constraints at bottom and build nested 'and' combining all atomic constraints one by one.\n\nLet's verify:\n\nFor N=2, total constraints = 6\n\nThere are 5 nested 'and's in the example:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and  ( <  ch0 97)  ( >=  ch0 65))  ( <=  ch0 90))  ( <  ch1 97))  ( >=  ch1 65))  ( <=  ch1 90)))\n\nThat matches constraints count -1 (6-1=5).\n\nSo, apparently the nesting is on all atomic constraints, and the 3 constraints of each variable are joined the same way.\n\nTherefore, for N=19:\n\nTotal constraints = 19 * 3 = 57\n\nNesting: 56 'and's\n\nThe nested 'and's join all atomic constraints in the order:\n\n( < ch0 97)\n( >= ch0 65)\n( <= ch0 90)\n( < ch1 97)\n( >= ch1 65)\n( <= ch1 90)\n...\n( < ch18 97)\n( >= ch18 65)\n( <= ch18 90)\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and ... ( < ch0 97) ( >= ch0 65)) ( <= ch0 90)) ( < ch1 97)) ( >= ch1 65)) ( <= ch1 90)) ... ( <= ch18 90)))\n\nA huge nested chain of 'and's.\n\nWe will generate 56 nested 'and's combining all 57 constraints.\n\nFormat example for final piece with 3 constraints:\n\n(( < ch0 97) ( >= ch0 65)) combined with 'and' is:\n\n(and ( < ch0 97) ( >= ch0 65))\n\nthen ( <= ch0 90) is combined as:\n\n(and (and ( < ch0 97) ( >= ch0 65)) ( <= ch0 90))\n\nThen next constraint ( < ch1 97)\n\nSo the nesting for all constraints looks like:\n\n(and (and (and (and ... ( < ch0 97) ( >= ch0 65)) ( <= ch0 90)) ( < ch1 97)) ( >= ch1 65)) ( <= ch1 90)) ... )\n\nSo each new atomic constraint is nested via another 'and' wrapping the previous expression with the current constraint.\n\nSo the structure is left-associative nested 'and' as:\n\n(and ... (and (and (and ( < ch0 97) ( >= ch0 65)) ( <= ch0 90)) ( < ch1 97)) ( >= ch1 65)) ( <= ch1 90)) ... ( <= ch18 90))\n\nThis matches the example pattern.\n\nTherefore I will generate the nested 'and's from innermost to outermost:\n\n- Start from last atomic constraint ( <= ch18 90)\n\n- Nest with ( >= ch18 65)\n\n- Nest with ( < ch18 97)\n\n- Nest with previous constraints for ch17's 3 constraints: ( <= ch17 90), ( >= ch17 65), ( < ch17 97)\n\nand so on all the way down to ( < ch0 97).\n\nAt the end, wrap everything in (assert ...)\n\nWe will write output precisely like the examples with spacing:\n\n- A space before and after symbols ( <, >=, <=)\n\n- Variables written as ch0, ch1, ..., ch18\n\n- Numbers: 97, 65, 90\n\n- Use multiple nested (and (and (and ...))) forms\n\nLet's generate this with code to avoid human mistake, but here writing it manually as per the pattern.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and ( <  ch0 97)  ( >=  ch0 65))  ( <=  ch0 90))  ( <  ch1 97))  ( >=  ch1 65))  ( <=  ch1 90))  ( <  ch2 97))  ( >=  ch2 65))  ( <=  ch2 90))  ( <  ch3 97))  ( >=  ch3 65))  ( <=  ch3 90))  ( <  ch4 97))  ( >=  ch4 65))  ( <=  ch4 90))  ( <  ch5 97))  ( >=  ch5 65))  ( <=  ch5 90))  ( <  ch6 97))  ( >=  ch6 65))  ( <=  ch6 90))  ( <  ch7 97))  ( >=  ch7 65))  ( <=  ch7 90))  ( <  ch8 97))  ( >=  ch8 65))  ( <=  ch8 90))  ( <  ch9 97))  ( >=  ch9 65))  ( <=  ch9 90))  ( <  ch10 97))  ( >=  ch10 65))  ( <=  ch10 90))  ( <  ch11 97))  ( >=  ch11 65))  ( <=  ch11 90))  ( <  ch12 97))  ( >=  ch12 65))  ( <=  ch12 90))  ( <  ch13 97))  ( >=  ch13 65))  ( <=  ch13 90))  ( <  ch14 97))  ( >=  ch14 65))  ( <=  ch14 90))  ( <  ch15 97))  ( >=  ch15 65))  ( <=  ch15 90))  ( <  ch16 97))  ( >=  ch16 65))  ( <=  ch16 90))  ( <  ch17 97))  ( >=  ch17 65))  ( <=  ch17 90))  ( <  ch18 97))  ( >=  ch18 65))  ( <=  ch18 90)))\n</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1907, "completion_tokens": 2246, "total_tokens": 4153, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

For each distinct pair (i,j) with i<j:\n   - (>= in_i in_j)\n   - (>  in_i in_j)\n   \n   So every distinct pair has two constraints, forming a \"strict\" ordering: in_i > in_j for i < j but also (>= in_i in_j) is redundantly stated.\n\n   Actually, reviewing the examples, for i<j we have both (>= in_i in_j) and (> in_i in_j).\n\n   Wait, these two directly contradict unless variables can be non-strictly ordered and strictly ordered\u2014impossible.\n\n   No, from the examples, we see ( >= in_i in_j ) and ( > in_i in_j ), nested as pairs for each pair i<j.\n\n   Observe the example for N=2:\n\n   (assert (and (and (and (and (and  \n       (>= in0 in1)  \n       (> in0 in1)) \n       (not (= in0 in)))  \n       (>= in0 in))  \n       (not (= in1 in)))  \n       (>= in1 in)))\n\n   So the example is unusual: There is also a (not (= in_i in)) and (>= in_i in) for each variable.\n\n   Similarly, for N=8 and N=13, the pattern is:\n\n   - For all pairs i < j:\n     (>= in_i in_j)\n     (> in_i in_j)\n   \n   - For each variable in_i:\n     (not (= in_i in))\n     (>= in_i in)\n\n   Here, 'in' appears to be a constant or variable to compare with, possibly some minimal bound. Since it stays the same, no need to infer its meaning, just replicate.\n\n2. Nesting in the examples is very deep, as successive (and ...) wrapping all constraints.\n\n3.

For each variable in_i:\n\n   (not (= in_i in))\n   (>=   in_i in)\n\n5. Finally, all these constraints are combined in one top-level (assert (and ...)) \n\nThe only difference between examples is the number N, range over in{0..N-1}.\n\nOur task: For N=20, create the constraint:\n\n(assert (and \n          [for all pairs i<j: (>= in_i in_j) ( > in_i in_j)]\n          [for each i: (not (= in_i in))  (>= in_i in)]\n       ))\n\nAdditionally, the output must be exactly in canonical SMT-LIB format, no extra commentary, exactly as in examples (with appropriate nesting). \n\nFrom the examples, the nesting is very deep with a chain of nested (and ...) expressions combining the constraints in a left-associated way:\n\n(and (and (and ... (constraint1) (constraint2)) (constraint3)) (constraint4)) ....\n\nSo for M constraints, this is nested like:\n\n(and (and (and (and constraint1 constraint2) constraint3) constraint4) ... constraintM)\n\nTo do this for many constraints, we should build nested (and) expressions like:\n\n(and c1 c2 ...) = (and (and ... (and c1 c2) c3) c4) ...\n\nDo exactly as above.\n\nGiven the number of constraints:\n\nNumber of pair constraints = number of pairs * 2\nPairs = (N * (N-1))/2 = (20 * 19)/2 = 190\nConstraints from pairs = 190 * 2 = 380\n\nNumber of variable constraints = N * 2 = 20 * 2 = 40\n\nTotal constraints = 420\n\nEach constraint is a simple S-expression like (>= in_i in_j) or (> in_i in_j) or (not (= in_i in)) or (>= in_i in)\n\nWe will flatten them all into a list of S-expressions, then nest as left-associative (and ...) chain.\n\n---\n\nNow to writing the final SMT-LIB string:\n\n- Variables are in0 .. in19\n- Constant 'in' is as is\n- For all i<j: ( >= in_i in_j) ( > in_i in_j)\n- For all i: (not ( = in_i in)) (>= in_i in)\n\nImplementation plan:\n\n1. Create a list named \"constraints\"\n2. Append each pair constraint (>=) then (>) for all i<j\n3. Append each variable constraint (not (= in_i in)) then (>= in_i in)\n4. Nest constraints in left-associative way using (and ...)\n\nWe must replicate the exact spacing and parentheses style from the examples.\n\nThe examples have two spaces for indentation inside the and, but since output is a single string no line breaks, we just follow spacing:\n\nThe examples have a pattern:\n\n(assert (and (and ... (constraint1) (constraint2)) (constraint3)) (constraint4) ...)\n\nEach constraint is surrounded by a space before and after relation/operator, like: ( >=  in0 in1) with 2 spaces after '>='\n\nMust replicate this carefully.\n\n---\n\nExamples use double space before and after operator:\n\n( >=  in0 in1)\n( >  in0 in1)\n\n(not ( = in0 in))\n( >=  in0 in)\n\nNote:\n- Each expression is in the form: (RELATION  operand1 operand2)\n- There are two spaces after relation symbol (like >=, >, =) inside parentheses\n\nE.g. ( >=  in0 in1)\n\nSpaces between everything are two spaces after relation symbol, single between other tokens.\n\n---\n\nWe must not add commentary or line breaks, join entire expression as a single

Then groups are combined with cross relations involving the \"leaders\" of each group (lowest indices).\n\n---\n\nGoal is to generate constraints for N=18.\n\nWe should break the 18 inputs into balanced groups; the previous examples suggest using grouping near powers of two or groups of 4 and 6 elements.\n\nFor 18, natural grouping:  \n- 3 groups of 6 inputs (6 + 6 + 6 =18) or 4 groups (4 + 4 + 4 + 6) etc.\n\nBecause 12 was done as two groups of 6, 18 can be broken into 3 groups of 6.\n\nFor each group of 6, we can reuse the pattern seen in the previous examples (like for 6), then merge the groups similarly.\n\n---\n\nLet's analyze a group of 6 inputs first (like in parts of N=12):\n\nFor indices a..a+5:\n\nWe want to encode sort order so that:  \n- in_a \u2264 in_{a+1}, in_a \u2264 in_{a+2}, in_{a+1} \u2264 in_{a+2} (like a triple order)  \n- ( \u2264 in_{a+3} in_{a+4}), ( \u2264 in_{a+3} in_{a+5}), ( \u2264 in_{a+4} in_{a+5})  \n- ( \u2264 in_a in_{a+3}), ( \u2264 in_{a+1} in_{a+3}), ( \u2264 in_{a+2} in_{a+3})  \n- And similarly \"bridging\" the groups between 0..2 and 3..5  \nThis is coherent with the pattern in N=12 where the first 6 are split into two groups of 3.\n\n---\n\nThus, for each group of 6 (indices: 0..5, 6..11, 12..17):\n\nLet's write the constraints as we saw for 6 elements:\n\nGroup of 6, assume indices i,i+1,...,i+5:  \n- ( <= in_i in_{i+1})  \n- ( <= in_i in_{i+2})  \n- ( <= in_{i+1} in_{i+2})   \n\n- ( <= in_{i+3} in_{i+4})  \n- ( <= in_{i+3} in_{i+5})  \n- ( <= in_{i+4} in_{i+5})   \n\n- ( <= in_i in_{i+3})  \n- ( <= in_{i+1} in_{i+3})  \n- ( <= in_{i+2} in_{i+3})\n\n---\n\nAfter defining these for the 3 groups of 6 each:\n\nGroups:  \n\nG0: in0..in5  \nG1: in6..in11  \nG2: in12..in17\n\nNow, we need to \"merge\" these 3 groups by constraints.\n\nLooking at N=9 (3 groups of 3), the pattern is:\n\n- within each group of 3: triples ordered\n\n- cross group constraints:\n\n  ( <= in0 in3), ( <= in1 in3), ( <= in2 in3)\n  \n  ( <= in0 in5), ( <= in1 in5), ( <= in2 in5)\n  \n  ( <= in3 in5), ( <= in4 in5)\n  \n  in other words, the last group element is greater than all previous groups.\n\nSimilarly for 18, merging G0, G1, G2:\n\nWe need inequalities making all elements of G0 \u2264 elements of G1, all elements of G1 \u2264 elements of G2.\n\nUsing the minimal \"bridge\" set of constraints, like:\n\n- All elements in G0 \u2264 the \"first\" element of G1 (in6 maybe in6 or in7?), but in examples given, usually in_{start of next group} is used as \"pivot\" to satisfy inequalities.\n\n- Then similarly, all elements of G1 \u2264 first element of G2.\n\nConsequently:\n\nCross constraints for the groups:  \n\n- \u2200 i in 0..5: ( <= in_i in6)  -- G0 \u2264 in6 (first of G1)\n\n- \u2200 i in 6..11: ( <= in_i in12) -- G1 \u2264 in12 (first of G2)\n\n---\n\nSummarizing constraints:\n\n1) For each group of 6, apply the set of inequalities for group internal ordering:\n\n- ( <= in0 in1), ( <= in0 in2), ( <= in1 in2)  \n- ( <= in3 in4), ( <= in3 in5), ( <= in4 in5)  \n- ( <= in0 in3), ( <= in1 in3), ( <= in2 in3)\n\nfor group 0\n\nsimilarly for group 1 (indices 6...11) and group 2 (indices 12...17).\n\n2) For cross-group inequalities:\n\n- ( <= in0 in6), ( <= in1 in6), ..., ( <= in5 in6)  \n- ( <= in6 in12), ( <= in7 in12), ..., ( <= in11 in12)\n\n---\n\nFinally, we wrap all these inequalities in a single top-level `(assert (and ...))`.\n\n---\n\nLet's now explicitly write all inequalities:\n\nGroup 0: (indices 0..5)  \n( <= in0 in1)  \n( <= in0 in2)  \n( <= in1 in2)  \n( <= in3 in4)  \n( <= in3 in5)

( - in 1) 1) 1) ... ) 1)\n\nwith nested minus operators inside.\n\nThe nested minus operators in constraint i (starting at i=3) has (i-3) nested minus operations.\n\nFor example:\n\nconstraint 3 (i=3): i-3 = 0 nested minus => ( > in 1)\n\nconstraint 4 (i=4): i-3 =1 nested minus: ( > ( - in 1) 1)\n\nconstraint 5 (i=5): i-3=2 nested minus: ( > ( - ( - in 1) 1) 1)\n\n...\n\nconstraint 25 (i=25): i-3=22 nested minus:\n\n( > ( - ( - (... ( - in 1) 1) ... ) 1) 1)\n\nwith 22 nested minus chained.\n\n---\n\nTherefore, constraints are:\n\n1) ( >= in 0)\n\n2) ( <= in 10)\n\n3) ( > in 1)\n\n4) ( > ( - in 1) 1)\n\n5) ( > ( - ( - in 1) 1) 1)\n\n...\n\n25) ( > ( - ( - ( ... ( - in 1) 1) ... ) 1) 1) with 22 nested minus\n\n---\n\nNext, we must nest these constraints 25 times inside (and ...) as per the examples.\n\nExample nesting:\n\n(assert (and C1 (and C2 (and C3 (and ... (and C24 C25) ... ))))\n\n---\n\nNote: the given examples have 10 nested and's, probably one fewer than constraints, since the last two constraints are combined as (and C24 C25).\n\nHence for 25 constraints, there should be 24 nested and's.\n\nSo general nesting:\n\n(assert (and C1 (and C2 (and C3 (and ... (and C24 C25) ... ))))\n\nTherefore, for N=16, total constraints=25 -> 24 nested and's.\n\n---\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n- total constraints: 25\n\n- nest 24 'and's as (and C1 (and C2 (and ...

The constraints are nested (and ...) expressions combining a set of inequalities (<= inX inY), following a certain pattern especially inspired by merge-sort tree or divide-and-conquer merges.\n\nFrom the given examples:\n- For N=3, the constraints represent sorting 3 elements by pairwise inequalities.\n- For larger N, the pattern is recursively merging sorted sublists, adding inequalities to ensure the combined list is sorted.\n\nLooking at the bigger Ns:\n\nN=3, N=8, N=9, N=12, N=14, N=18, N=19\n\nReviewing the constraints for N=19:\n\n- Sub-lists of different sizes are merged with constraints connecting the sub-lists.\n- The structure looks like a balanced binary merge tree enforcing ordering.\n\nThe merge pattern works as follows:\n\n1. Split input into two parts,\n2. Ensure each part is sorted,\n3. Add inequalities to merge the two parts.\n\nFor N=25, we should find a similar pattern, presumably splitting into parts and applying constraints recursively.\n\nWe need to guess how the input is split for N=25.\n\nLooking at the previous:\n- N=19 split roughly into 10 and 9 elements.\n- N=18 split roughly into 9 and 9 elements.\n\nSo for N=25, splitting could be about 12 and 13.\n\nLet's look at the smallest where the difference is 1 (like 12 and 13).\n\nThe constraints have this pattern:\n\n- For each half, enforce sortedness as in smaller N.\n- Add constraints linking the two halves.\n\nWe can break down as:\n\n- Left half: in0..in11 (12 elements)\n- Right half: in12..in24 (13 elements)\n\nFrom given constraints for smaller Ns:\n\n- For N=12 and N=13 (not given), N=12 constraints are known.\n- For N=14 constraints are given (split into groups of 7 and 7).\n\nSimilarly for N=25:\n\n- Construct constraints for N=12 (in0..in11)\n- Construct constraints for N=13 (in12..in24)\n- Then add inequalities connecting right half's minimum (in12) with left half's elements to establish order.\n\nDetail steps:\n\n1.

For N=13 (in12..in24). N=13 constraints are not given directly \u2014 but given pattern for N=12 with 12 elements and N=14 with 14 elements, so N=13 would be similar.\n\nTaking N=14's second half (in7..in13) as a model for in12..in24 at size 13:\n\nFrom N=14 (second half constraints):\n\n(<= in7 in8), (<= in9 in10), (<= in7 in9), (<= in8 in9), (<= in11 in12), (<= in11 in13), (<= in12 in13),\n(<= in7 in11), (<= in8 in11), (<= in9 in11), (<= in10 in11)\n\nThese represent 7 elements merges roughly.\n\nN=13 is close to N=14, so let's assume a similar pattern for in12..in24.\n\nBut since no explicit N=13 constraints are given, the best consistent approach is:\n\n- Build constraints for N=12 on first half (in0..in11)\n- Build constraints for N=13 on second half (in12..in24) recursively (based on merge sort tree)\n\n3. Connecting the two halves:\n\nFor previous Ns, connections go like:\n\n- Place constraints (<= in0 in12), (<= in1 in12), ..., (<= in11 in12), i.e., all first half elements <= first element of second half.\n\nSimilarly for N=19:\n\n(<= in0 in10), (<= in1 in10), ..., (<= in9 in10)\n\nThis is from the pattern observed.\n\nTherefore for N=25:\n\nAdding constraints:\n\n(<= in0 in12), (<= in1 in12), ..., (<= in11 in12)\n\nOur final constraint will be an assert with and clauses combining:\n\n- N=12 constraints on in0..in11\n- N=13 constraints on in12..in24\n- Connecting constraints\n\nWe need to reproduce the exact SMT-LIB expression format using nested ands for all constraints.\n\nWe must represent the constraints with nested ands matching the canonical style in the examples.\n\nGiven the complexity, the best is to:\n\n- Write recursive merge constraints for N=25, dividing into N=12 and N=13 parts.\n\n---\n\nFirst, let's gather constraints for N=12 on in0..in11 (from the example):\n\nN=12 constraints:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and\n  (<= in0 in1) (<= in0 in2)) (<= in1 in2))\n  (<= in3 in4)) (<= in3 in5)) (<= in4 in5))\n  (<= in0 in3)) (<= in1 in3)) (<= in2 in3))\n  (<= in6 in7)) (<= in6 in8)) (<= in7 in8))\n  (<= in9 in10)) (<= in9 in11)) (<= in10 in11))\n  (<= in6 in9)) (<= in7 in9)) (<= in8 in9))\n  (<= in0 in6)) (<= in1 in6)) (<= in2 in6))\n  (<= in3 in6)) (<= in4 in6)) (<= in5 in6))))\n\n---\n\nNext, for N=13 (in12..in24):\n\nWe follow the same approach but we must define constraints for 13 elements. Using the merge pattern of splitting 13 into (6 and 7 elements), then adding constraints for smaller parts.\n\nWe recursively define constraints for N=6 and N=7:\n\n- N=6: not given but can be derived similarly (based on N=3 example multiplied)\n- N=7: like N=8 but one less.\n\nHowever, since N=6 and N=7 are missing explicitly, but to be consistent with the given larger Ns, we notice that the merge sort tree merges 3-element or 4-element or other sublists.\n\nWe can use the known constraints for N=3 (3 elements):\n\n(assert (and (and (<= in0 in1) (<= in0 in2)) (<= in1 in2)))\n\nSimilarly, we can reuse this for sublists of size 3.\n\nFor N=7:\n\nWe can split 7 elements into 3 and 4:\n\n- For first 3 elements (in0..in2) use N=3 constraints\n- For next 4 elements (in3..in6) assume N=4 constraints (not given, but presumably similar)\n- Then merge them.\n\nBut since the final question is for N=25, and to keep the answer within scope, we can accept that the constraints for the right half (N=13) follow the same pattern as for N=12 but with last index advanced and adding required constraints.\n\nThus, effectively we assume the constraints for the right half are similar to N=12 but with indices shifted by +12, plus one extra element.\n\nWe'll replicate N=12 constraints for in12..in23, plus constraints for in24, adding merges for last element.\n\n---\n\nGiven the amount of detail, and the user only requested the final SMT-LIB constraint string for N=25 following the same pattern (and the examples), I will generate the final nested (assert (and ...)) with:\n\n- First the N=12 constraints on in0..in11, same as given.\n\n- Then the N=13 constraints on in12..in24, formed similarly (using the same pattern as N=12 but extended).\n\n- Finally connecting constraints: ( <= in0 in12), ..., (<= in11 in12).\n\nI'll write exact inequalities for N=12 part and N=13 part (modeling N=13 after N=12, adding the extra element at the end) and add the final cross inequalities.\n\nThen wrap everything into nested ands in canonical SMT-LIB format.\n\n---\n\nSteps for N=13 constraints (in12..in24):\n\nModel after N=12 constraints pattern on (in12..in23), then adding handling for in24.\n\nApply same pattern as N=12 on in12..in23:\n\n- Sortedness on in12..in23 using the N=12 pattern with +12.\n\n- For in24, similar to adding constraints linking in24 and in23 (and previous constraints).\n\nSpecifically:\n\nFrom N=8:\n\n- The last element constraints are usually linked to previous.\n\nSo for N=13:\n\n- in12..in23 sorted similarly (N=12 pattern with indices +12)\n- Then link in24 to appropriate elements (like in11 in N=12 pattern linked to in12 in N=13).\n\nAdding (<= in23 in24), and inequalities merging in24 similarly to the previous last element merges.\n\n---\n\nWriting all the constraints explicitly is large but exactly what the user wants.\n\n---\n\nTherefore, the final answer will be a big nested (assert (and ...)) clause combining:\n\n- N=12 constraints for in0..in11 (as in example)\n- N=13 constraints for in12..in24 (modeled similarly)\n- Cross constraints between in0..in11 and in12\n\n---\n\nI'll write out this

(and (and ... ))))`.\n\nSince it's cumbersome, but the example does.\n\nHence we will replicate the same number of `(and` nested wrappers.\n\nNumber of `(and` wrappers is number_of_constraints -1.\n\nNumber_of_constraints = 17, so 16 nested `(and`.\n\nWrite them as per the example:\n\n(assert (and  \n  (and  \n    (and  \n      ...  \n      (and (>= in 0) (<= in 10))  \n      (> in 1))  \n    (> (- in 1) 1))  \n  (> (- (- in 1) 1) 1))  \n... repeated last to the end.\n\n(And then close all these nested `and)` )\n\nOk, now produce the SMT-LIB output accordingly.\n\nThe variable is always `in 0` or `in 1`? From examples, they only used `in 1`.\n\nSo the constraints apply on `in 0` or `in 1`? The examples in the question always reference `(>= in 0)`, `(<= in 10)`, and `(> in 1)`.\n\nIn the example:\n\n`(>= in 0)` means variable `in` with index 0: `in 0`.\n\n`(> in 1)` means variable `in` with index 1: `in 1`.\n\nThe nested `(> (- in 1) 1)` means variable `in` with index 1.\n\nSo there are two variables, `in 0` and `in 1`.\n\nGiven the question and the examples, the first two constraints `(>= in 0)` and `(<= in 10)` apply to `in 0`, and rest apply to `in 1`.\n\nHence:\n\n- `(>=  in 0)`\n- `(<=  in 10)`\n- `(>   in 1)`\n- then nested constraints on `( - in 1)` repeated nested.\n\nSimilarly, we keep `in 0` for first two constraints and `in 1` for rest.\n\nWe follow the example format exactly.\n\nTherefore, final for N=15:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  \n  (>=  in 0)  \n  (<=  in 10))  \n  (>   in 1))  \n  (>  (-  in 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))))) \n\nwith 16 `(and` nested (17 constraints).\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  \n  (>=  in 0)  \n  (<=  in 10))  \n  (>  in 1))  \n  (>  (-  in 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n  (>  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  (-  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))))) \n</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1446, "completion_tokens": 3588, "total_tokens": 5034, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

(not (= ...))) for that variable.\n\nExample, in N=5:\n\n(assert (and  (and (and (and (and\n  (and (and (and (and \n    (not (= in0 65)) (= in0 66))\n    (not (= in1 69)) (= in1 70))\n    (not (= in2 73)) (not (= in2 74))\n    (not (= in3 65)) (= in3 66))\n    (not (= in4 69)) (= in4 70))\n))))\n\nSo general pattern:\n- For each i:\n  - if i%4 == 0 or 3: (and (not (= in i 65)) (= in i 66))\n  - if i%4 == 1: (and (not (= in i 69)) (= in i 70))\n  - if i%4 == 2: (and (not (= in i 73)) (not (= in i 74)))\n\nN=17 means i in [0..16].\n\nWe'll produce 17 nested and's where the innermost is the first variable and then build the nested structure upward.\n\nWe'll write the constraints for each i, then nest together.\n\nLet's write constraints for each i:\n\ni: pattern and constraints\n\n0 (0%4=0): (and (not (= in0 65)) (= in0 66))\n1 (1): (and (not (= in1 69)) (= in1 70))\n2 (2): (and (not (= in2 73)) (not (= in2 74)))\n3 (3): (and (not (= in3 65)) (= in3 66))\n4 (0): (and (not (= in4 65)) (= in4 66))\n5 (1): (and (not (= in5 69)) (= in5 70))\n6 (2): (and (not (= in6 73)) (not (= in6 74)))\n7 (3): (and (not (= in7 65)) (= in7 66))\n8 (0): (and (not (= in8 65)) (= in8 66))\n9 (1): (and (not (= in9 69)) (= in9 70))\n10 (2): (and (not (= in10 73)) (not (= in10 74)))\n11 (3): (and (not (= in11 65)) (= in11 66))\n12 (0): (and (not (= in12 65)) (= in12 66))\n13 (1): (and (not (= in13 69)) (= in13 70))\n14 (2): (and (not (= in14 73)) (not (= in14 74)))\n15 (3): (and (not (= in15 65)) (= in15 66))\n16 (0): (and (not (= in16 65)) (= in16 66))\n\nNow we must nest these all in a chain of (and ...). The example shows very deeply nested and's aligned to the pattern:\n\n(and\n (and\n  (and ... (and (constraints_i) (constraints_{i+1})) ...)\n ) ... )\n\nThe last two constraints nested at the deepest.\n\nWe begin from the last pair (constraints for i=15 and i=16), then nest upwards.\n\nFor N=17, the nesting is:\n\n(assert (and\n  (and\n   ...\n    (and (and constraints_i) constraints_{i+1})\n  ...\n  )\n  (constraints_0)\n))\n\nWe can write a Python helper to generate nested and's, but here, preparing manually.\n\nActually, the examples show left nested pattern:\n\nFor N=5:\n\n(assert (and\n  (and\n    (and\n      (and\n        (and\n          (and\n            (and\n              (and\n                (and (not (= in0 65)) (= in0 66)) (not (= in1 69)) (= in1 70))\n              (not (= in2 73)) (not (= in2 74)))\n            (not (= in3 65)) (= in3 66))\n          (not (= in4 69)) (= in4 70))\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  )\n))\n\nMeaning constraints are combined two at a time in nested and.\n\nBut in the given example for N=5, actually the top-level (assert (and ...)) wraps a big nest of (and ... (and ... (and ... (...)))) combining all constraints at once.\n\nSo to be precise, each i's constraints consist of two constraints:\n\n- For i mod4=0 or 3: (and (not (= in i 65)) (= in i 66))\n- For i mod4=1: (and (not (= in i 69)) (= in i 70))\n- For i mod4=2: (and (not (= in i 73)) (not (= in i 74)))\n\nFinally, all i's constraints combined in a nested left-associative (and (and (and ...)))\n\nSo:\n\n- Write internal constraints per i\n- Combine the first two constraints of i into (and (...)(...))\n- Combine in nested (and ... (and ...)) manner for i = 0..16\n\nImplementation plan (pseudocode):\n- For i in [0..N-1]:\n  - Determine constraints c1, c2 per rule.\n  - Compose variable_constraint_i = (and c1 c2)\n- Then nest as left nested and:\n\nnested_and = variable_constraint_0\n\nfor i in 1..N-1:\n    nested_and = (and nested_and variable_constraint_i)\n\nWrap with (assert nested_and)\n\nLet's create the final SMT-LIB string accordingly.\n\nWe have identifiers: in0, in1, ..., in16\nValues: 65,66,69,70,73,74 as per pattern\n\nExample for i=0: (and (not (= in0 65)) (= in0 66))\ni=1: (and (not (= in1 69)) (= in1 70))\ni=2: (and (not (= in2 73)) (not (= in2 74)))\netc.\n\nNow let's build the final answer accordingly.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (not ( = in0 65)) (= in0 66)) (not ( = in1 69))) (= in1 70)) (not ( = in2 73))) (not ( = in2 74))) (not ( = in3 65))) (= in3 66)) (not ( = in4 65))) (= in4 66)) (not ( = in5 69))) (= in5 70)) (not ( = in6 73))) (not ( = in6 74))) (not ( = in7 65))) (= in7 66)) (not ( = in8 65))) (= in8 66)) (not ( = in9 69))) (= in9 70)) (not ( = in10 73))) (not ( = in10 74))) (not ( = in11 65))) (= in11 66)) (not ( = in12 65))) (= in12 66)) (not ( = in13 69))) (= in13 70)) (not ( = in14 73))) (not ( = in14 74))) (not ( = in15 65))) (= in15 66)) (not ( = in16 65))) (= in16 66)))))))))))))))))))))))</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 868, "completion_tokens": 2076, "total_tokens": 2944, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

For N=15, we have 15 input variables: in0 to in14.\n\n2. From the pattern in the given examples:\n   - For each pair i < j, the constraints: \n     (>= in_i in_j) and (> in_i in_j)\n   - However, notice in the samples: for pairs (in_i, in_j) with i < j, the constraints are:\n     (>= in_i in_j) followed by (> in_i in_j)\n     So for each pair (i, j) with i < j:\n       (>= in_i in_j)\n       (> in_i in_j)\n\n   (Note: The pair constraints are duplicated, one with >= and one with >; probably an error in example formatting? Or maybe per pair we have (>= in_i in_j) and ( > in_i in_j)? This would be contradictory, so question is which one prevails.\n\n   Actually, looking carefully:\n   For example, in N=2:\n   (>= in0 in1)\n   (> in0 in1)\n\n   But (>= in0 in1) and (> in0 in1) cannot both be true simultaneously unless > subsumes >=.\n\n   The pattern is actually:\n\n   From N=2:\n\n   (>= in0 in1) ( > in0 in1)\n\n   So both are asserted, and > certainly implies >=.\n\n   So apparently the pattern is for each pair (i,j) with i < j:\n   - assert (>= in_i in_j)\n   - assert (> in_i in_j)\n\n   So for N=15:\n   For every i<j from 0 to 14, we assert (>= in_i in_j) and (> in_i in_j)\n\n3. Then, per variable i, there is a pair of constraints:\n   (not (= in_i in))\n   (>= in_i in)\n\n4. All these are combined under a top-level (and ...) wrapped by a top-level assert.\n\n5. The big conjunction is nested as shown in the examples \u2014 repeated (and ...) wrapping the previous ones.\n\n   For example, N=3, the top-level is:\n   (assert (and (and (and ... ) ... ) ... ))\n\n   The number of (and)'s nesting is equal to the total number of conjuncts minus 1 (each added conjunct nested inside).\n\n6. So the total conjuncts are:\n\n   - For pairs: number of pairs * 2 constraints each\n\n   Number of pairs for N=15 = 15*14/2 = 105 pairs\n\n   Each pair has 2 constraints => 210 constraints\n\n   - For variables: 2 constraints each => 15 * 2 = 30 constraints\n\n   Total number of conjuncts = 210 + 30 = 240\n\n7. The nesting construction:\n\n   Start with the first constraint\n\n   Then:\n\n     (and c1 c2)\n\n     then\n\n     (and (and c1 c2) c3)\n\n     then\n\n     (and (and (and c1 c2) c3) c4)\n\n     ... and so on.\n\n   So a left-nested chain of (and (and (and ... )\n\n8. The order of constraints, by examining examples, is:\n   - First all pair constraints in order by increasing i, then j (i<j order)\n     for each pair:\n       (>= in_i in_j), then ( > in_i in_j)\n   - Then, for each variable i from 0 to N-1:\n       (not (= in_i in)) then (>= in_i in)\n\n9. We construct the string accordingly with proper spaces.\n\n10. The variable \"in\" is single; variables are \"in0\", \"in1\", ..., \"in14\".\n\n11. We must replicate the exact format including spacing around operators and parentheses.\n\n12. So, the output is:\n\n(assert (and\n\n[one big nested and structure with all 240 constraints]\n\n))\n\n13. No additional commentary is allowed inside <answer> tags.\n\n14. The input is prepared carefully. Each constraint is surrounded by spaces inside the and, e.g.:\n\n( >=  in0 in1)\n\n( >  in0 in1)\n\n(not ( = in0 in))\n\n( >=  in0 in)\n\n15. So be sure to produce spaces consistent with examples.\n\nNow, let's programmatically output the nested expression.\n\nWe must generate a left nested chain:\n\nstart with first constraint\n\nfor each next constraint c:\n\n  prev = (and prev c)\n\nAt last, put it in (assert prev)\n\nLet's denote:\n\npairs_constraints = []\n\nfor i in range(0,15):\n\n  for j in range(i+1,15):\n\n

step4) ...)\n\nFor large N, the nesting depth is (number_of_inequalities - 1).\n\nWe will create a list of all inequalities in lex order of pairs (i,j) with i<j.\n\nThen nest them all from left to

i in range(19) for j in range(i+1, 19)]  # 171 pairs\n\nThen inequalities_strings = [\"( >  in{i} in{j})\" for (i,j) in pairs]\n\nThen nest from the left:\n\nnested = inequalities_strings[0]\n\nfor inequalities_strings[1:]:\n\n  nested = \"(and \" + nested + \" \" + next_ineq + \")\"\n\nThen wrap with (assert (and ...)) but we already have top-level and with nesting:\n\nActually the examples just wrap all conjunctions deeply nested inside one top-level assert and.\n\nReviewing the examples: Actually, the top-level is (assert (and <nested>)) where <nested> is the heavy nested chain of ands.\n\nSo the outer layer is one (assert (and <nested>)) with the nested conjunction inside.\n\nThus we do:\n\nfinal_str = \"(assert (and \" + nested + \"))\"\n\nHence, we will produce the left deep

(and (and per-variable.constraints) (and per-variable.constraints)) ... )  \n))  \n\nSpecifically, for each variable inX:  \n(and (not (= (mod inX 2) 0)) (= (mod inX 3) 0))  \n\nThen nest all these and'ed variable clauses into nested and's.\n\nThe nesting of the ands is deeply left associative; from examples, the outermost and wraps the innermost.\n\nExamples use left associativity, starting with last variable on the rightmost nested and.\n\nI will follow the pattern from N=17 example, which is:\n\n(assert (and \n  (and \n   (and \n    ...\n     (and  \n      (and (not (= (mod in0 2) 0)) (= (mod in0 3) 0)) \n      (and (not (= (mod in1 2) 0)) (= (mod in1 3) 0))\n     ) \n     ...\n    )\n   ) \n  )\n)\n\nSpecifically, the overall structure is:  \n(and  \n  (and  \n    (and ...  \n      (and (and per-variable constraints for in0) (and per-variable constraints for in1)) ... )\n\nHere is the plan:   \n\n- For i in [0..22] (since N=23), create:  \n  (and (not (= (mod in{i} 2) 0)) (= (mod in{i} 3) 0))\n\n- Nest all of these left-associatively in (and ...):\n\n(e.g. for 3 variables:   \n(assert (and  \n  (and  \n    (and (and (not (= (mod in0 2) 0)) (= (mod in0 3) 0))  \n         (and (not (= (mod in1 2) 0)) (= (mod in1 3) 0)))  \n    (and (not (= (mod in2 2) 0)) (= (mod in2 3) 0))  \n  )  \n) ) \n\nThis matches the nesting in the examples.)\n\nSo for 23 variables, we need 22 nested (and ... (and ...)) wrapping the inner two variable constraint ands.\n\nI will write a procedure to do this:\n\n- Start from last variable constraints (in22)  \n- For i in reversed order from 22 to 0, do:  \n  if i == 22:  \n    curr = (and (not (= (mod in22 2) 0)) (= (mod in22 3) 0))  \n  else:  \n    curr = (and  \n              (and (not (= (mod in{i} 2) 0)) (= (mod in{i} 3) 0))  \n              curr  \n           )\n\nFinally wrap curr in (assert (...))\n\nThis matches example nesting style.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (not ( = ( mod  in0 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in0 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in1 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in1 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in2 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in2 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in3 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in3 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in4 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in4 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in5 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in5 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in6 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in6 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in7 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in7 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in8 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in8 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in9 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in9 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in10 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in10 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in11 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in11 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in12 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in12 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in13 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in13 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in14 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in14 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in15 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in15 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in16 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in16 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in17 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in17 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in18 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in18 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in19 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in19 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in20 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in20 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in21 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in21 3) 0)) (and (not ( = ( mod  in22 2) 0))  ( =  ( mod  in22 3) 0)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2954, "completion_tokens": 1660, "total_tokens": 4614, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

Then the constraints for all variables are combined using a top-level 'and'.\n\nGiven that for N=21, we must create such constraints for variables in0 to in20.\n\nHence, the final formula is:\n\n(assert (and\n  (and ( ... constraints for in0 ... )\n       ( ... constraints for in1 ... )\n       ...\n       ( ... constraints for in20 ... )\n  )\n))\n\nEach per-variable constraint is of the form:\n(and\n   (not (= in_i 1))\n   (= (mod in_i 2) 0)\n   (not (= (div in_i 2) 1))\n   (= (mod (div in_i 2) 2) 0)\n   (not (= (div (div in_i 2) 2) 1))\n)\n\nSince the example uses nested (and (and (...)) ) style, but the problem asks for exact canonical SMT-LIB format, the minimal approach is to wrap everything into one top-level (assert (and ... all constraints ...)).\n\nThere is no mention explicitly forbidding using multiple args in and, and the examples use nested ands which implies same.\n\nTo match the style, I'll use nested and nesting exactly as in examples:\n\n- Firstly, grouping all per variable constraints into one big nested series of ands: starting from the first variable per-variable constraint, then nested and with next variable per-variable constraint, etc.\n\n- Each per-variable constraint is itself nested with a top-level and connecting its 5 constraints.\n\nThus, for each in_i we have:\n(and\n  (not (= in_i 1))\n  (= (mod in_i 2) 0)\n  (not (= (div in_i 2) 1))\n  (= (mod (div in_i 2) 2) 0)\n  (not (= (div (div in_i 2) 2) 1))\n)\n\nWe then nest all these with 'and's up to the number of variables (21).\n\nSo we must have 21 such nested ands.\n\nHence in SMT-LIB, the final would look like:\n\n(assert (and <and <and ... <and per-variable-in0 per-variable-in1> per-variable-in2> ... per-variable-in20>))\n\nWhere the nesting is N-1 times.\n\nI will generate the full string accordingly.\n\nNote:\nThe formatting must follow the original examples style precisely, including spacing and parentheses.\n\nIn the examples, the top-level is (assert (and <nested ands>)) without further parentheses.\n\nEach per-variable constraint is (and (not (= ...)) (= ...) (not (= ...)) (= ...) (not (= ...))).\n\nGiven the examples use extra spacings between tokens such as \" ( =  ( mod ... ) ... )\", I will replicate that style exactly.\n\nVariables go from in0 to in20 (21 variables indexed 0 to 20).\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (not ( =  in0 1))  ( =  ( mod  in0 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in0 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in0 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in0 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in1 1))  ( =  ( mod  in1 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in1 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in1 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in1 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in2 1))  ( =  ( mod  in2 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in2 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in2 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in2 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in3 1))  ( =  ( mod  in3 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in3 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in3 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in3 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in4 1))  ( =  ( mod  in4 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in4 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in4 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in4 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in5 1))  ( =  ( mod  in5 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in5 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in5 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in5 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in6 1))  ( =  ( mod  in6 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in6 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in6 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in6 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in7 1))  ( =  ( mod  in7 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in7 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in7 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in7 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in8 1))  ( =  ( mod  in8 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in8 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in8 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in8 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in9 1))  ( =  ( mod  in9 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in9 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in9 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in9 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in10 1))  ( =  ( mod  in10 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in10 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in10 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in10 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in11 1))  ( =  ( mod  in11 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in11 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in11 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in11 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in12 1))  ( =  ( mod  in12 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in12 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in12 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in12 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in13 1))  ( =  ( mod  in13 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in13 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in13 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in13 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in14 1))  ( =  ( mod  in14 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in14 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in14 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in14 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in15 1))  ( =  ( mod  in15 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in15 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in15 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in15 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in16 1))  ( =  ( mod  in16 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in16 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in16 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in16 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in17 1))  ( =  ( mod  in17 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in17 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in17 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in17 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in18 1))  ( =  ( mod  in18 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in18 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in18 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in18 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in19 1))  ( =  ( mod  in19 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in19 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in19 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in19 2) 2) 1))) (and (not ( =  in20 1))  ( =  ( mod  in20 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  in20 2) 1)))  ( =  ( mod  ( div  in20 2) 2) 0)) (not ( = ( div  ( div  in20 2) 2) 1)))))\n</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2868, "completion_tokens": 2575, "total_tokens": 5443, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_79b79be41f"}}, "error": null}

Variables are named as `in{row}{col}`, where row and col ranges depend on N.\n\n2. The constraints are layered lexicographically, with increasing inequalities of form:\n   - Simple chain inequalities between columns for `in0` row: `( < in02 in01)`, `( < in03 in02)`, etc. (for columns 1 to N-1)\n   - Inequalities involving the last column `in0(N-1)` added to elements in row 1 to row N-1, e.g., `( < (+ in61 in06) in01)`.\n   - Then inequalities ordering sums added to the last column variable, relating consecutive variables within rows.\n   - Then inequalities comparing sums between rows with the last columns added.\n   - Then lexicographic orderings from the bottom row upward by combining sums in nested fashion.\n\n3. There is a lot of nesting `(and (and ... ))` wrapping each pair of constraints, which eventually is a big nest.\n\n4. The most inner part are the simple inequalities; the nest layers increase with N-1 joins.\n\n5. For N=6, N=7, the pattern for the variable indices follows the same scheme:\n   - For 0th row: `in0_1` through `in0_{N-1}` with chains `( < in0i in0(i-1) )`\n   - For row j (from 1 to N-1) corresponding `in_j_i` variables with sums of last variables.\n\nHence for N=15:\n\n- We have rows from 0 to 14 (because row index goes from 0 to N-1)\n- Columns from 1 to 14 for `in0` variables\n- The last column for sums is `in0(14)` (index zero-based), used in sums for other rows similarly.\n\nFollowing the pattern in the examples, the transformation for N=15 is:\n\n- Chain inequalities between `in0_i` decreasing index, i=2 to N-1=14: `( < in0i in0(i-1))`\n- Then inequalities `( < (+ in j (N-1)) in (i-1) )` for row j from N-1 down to 1\n- Then inequalities ordering (+ in_j (N-1)) for same row indices (j)\n- Inequalities ordering sums involving rows `j` and `(j-1)`\n- Then lexicographic inequalities involving sums of deeper rows recursively upward to row 1.\n\nThe provided example for N=7 ends with 21 constraints coupled via nested `(and)` clauses.\n\nHence for N=15, the pattern extends similarly with more variables and summations.\n\nI will generate the full constraints string in exact form, preserving the naming and pattern, carefully following the given examples.\n\n------\n\nKey indices:\n\n- Rows: from 0 to 14\n- Columns for base: for row 0: in01 to in014\n- Last column index: 14\n- Variable naming: `in{row}{col}` with col zero-padded two digits (based on given samples which have col indices as two digits)\n\n------\n\nBuilding steps:\n\n1. Chain inequalities on row 0 decreasing order:\n\n   `( < in02 in01 )`, `( < in03 in02 )`, ..., `( < in014 in013 )`\n\n2. For rows j=14 down to 9, constraints `( < (+ in j 14) in (j-1) )`\n   \n   i.e., `( < (+ in1414) in13)`, etc.\n\nBut note from examples:\n\n- `( <  ( +  in (row)(N-1) ) in(i-1))` for i in 1..N-1, j in 1..N-1?\n\nActually from sample:\n\nFor N=7, constraints like:\n\n```\n( <  ( +  in61 in06) in01)\n( <  ( +  in62 in06) in02)\n...\n```\n\nSo for N=15, these look like:\n\nFor columns i = 1 to N-1=14:\n\n`( < (+ in(i+1)(N-1)) in(i-1))` where indices are zero-based? For row= i+1 and column = N-1.\n\nBut in the example, the row is 6 (for N=7), columns 1..5; row index is from 1..N-1.\n\nRather it's fixed: `in j (N-1)` + compared to `in (j-1)` (from row 0 columns) ?\n\nTherefore:\n\nFor j in 1..N-1:\n\n`( < (+ in j N-1) in(j-1))`\n\n---\n\nThen next constraints order sums of the form `( + in j N-1 )` in increasing order:\n\n`( < (+ in 2 N-1) (+ in 1 N-1))`, `( < (+ in 3 N-1) (+ in 2 N-1))`, ... up to `( < (+ in (N-1) N-1) (+ in (N-2) N-1))`\n\n---\n\nThen inequalities involving row N-2 with sums `( + in (N-2) (+ in (N-1) N-1))` compared to `( + in j N-1 )` for j in 1..N-2\n\nThis extends with lexicographic sums downward in rows \u2014 following the pattern for N=6 and N=7.\n\n---\n\nThese nested sums continue:\n\n- For row k, sums of the form:\n\n  `( + in k ( + in (k+1) ( + ... in (N-1) N-1 ) ) )`\n\n- Each compared lex order for next rows k+1\n\n---\n\nThe nesting is very deep, but the pattern is regular and repeats for all rows.\n\n---\n\nHence, the final SMT-LIB string will be:\n\n`(assert (and` followed by an N-1 long chain of nested `(and (...))` wrapping these inequalities from outermost to innermost.\n\n---\n\nImplementation plan:\n\n- Generate the top layer `(assert (and `\n\n- Generate chain inequalities on row0: `( < in0{i} in0{i-1} )` for i=2 to N-1\n\n- Generate inequalities `( < (+ in{i}{N-1}) in{i-1} )` for i=1 to N-1\n\n- Generate inequalities `( < (+ in{i}{N-1}) (+ in{i-1}{N-1}) )` for i=2 to N-1\n\n- Then recursively generate lex order inequalities involving sums for rows N-2 down to 1\n\nThis equals:\n\nFor k from N-2 down to 1, and i from k+1 to N-1:\n\n- `( < (+ in k (sum from k+1 to N-1)) (+ in i (sum from i+1 to N-1)) )`\n\nAnd these sums are nested as in examples.\n\n---\n\nExamples for clarity for the sums:\n\nAt row 1:\n\n`( + in1 ( + in2 ( + in3 ( ... ( + in14 in14 ) ...) ) ) )`\n\n---\n\nGiven the massive nesting, noting that the last examples (for N=6 and 7) have been auto-generated with many nested `(and ...)`, I will replicate the pattern for N=15.\n\n---\n\nVariables naming:\n\n- in{row}{col} where both indices are zero-padded two-digit integers if from example (`in02`, `in03`, etc.)\n\n- For row from 0 to 14 (two digit: `00` to `14`)\n\n- For cols 1 to 14 (two digit: `01` to `14`)\n\n---\n\nBuild the chain inequalities for row 0:\n\n`( < in02 in01 ) ( < in03 in02 ) ... ( < in014 in013 )`\n\nThen inequalities `( < (+ in{i}{14}) in{i-1, 2-digit} )` with i=1..14, for example\n\n`( < (+ in114) in01)` etc.\n\nThen the comparison of sums `( < (+ in{2}{14}) (+ in{1}{14}) )` etc.\n\n---\n\nThe complex lexicographic sums for rows 1 to 13 comparing sums of sums.\n\n---\n\nI will write a programmatic approach in the mind and flatten it into SMT-LIB with nested `(and`. Final answer will be just the SMT-LIB constraint.\n\n---\n\nBottom line: It is to create the canonical SMT-LIB line:\n\n`(assert (and (and (and ... ) ... ) ) )` with the parsed inequalities in correct order.\n\n---\n\nNow I proceed to craft the final SMT-LIB constraint string.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and

Starting from the 3rd constraint, all are of the form:\n   ( >  ( -  ... in 1) 1)\n   \n   Specifically, many nested subtracts from \"in 1\", each subtracting 1, repeating nested times equal to the index-2.\n\n   For example, at position 3 (index=3), it's ( > in 1 1)\n   At position 4, ( > (- in 1) 1)\n   At position 5, ( > (- (- in 1) 1) 1), and so on.\n\n3. The total number of constraints inside the top-level and is equal to N+1:\n   For N=2: 10 nested and's , and 2 constraints total (counting the examples given) or rather, the number of constraints seems to be N+1?\n   Actually, from the example text, it looks like the total number of constraints combined using nested and's is 10 for these examples.\n\nLooking carefully at the examples:\n\n- At N=2: The SMT-LIB code shows a top-level and with multiple nested and, 10 levels deep inside, with 10 constraints:\n   - (>= in 0)\n   - (<= in 10)\n   - ( > in 1)\n   - ( > (- in 1) 1)\n   - ( > (- (- in 1) 1) 1)\n   - ( > (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1)\n   - and so forth up to 10 constraints total inside that top-level and\n\nSimilarly for N=12 and N=22, the code structure is the same: 10 constraints total inside the top-level and, where constraints after the initial two seem to be similar with nested arithmetic slightly different.\n\nDoes the N value correspond to how many times these nested (> ...) conditions repeated?\n\nNo, the number of nested (and ... ) is always the same 10 times, as shown.\n\nRe-Examining:\n\nAt N=2: We have constraints:\n\n( >= in 0)\n( <= in 10)\n( > in 1)\n( > (- in 1) 1)\n( > (- (- in 1) 1) 1)\n( > (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1)\n( > (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)\n( > (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)\n( > (- (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)\n( > (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)\n\nSo the part after (>= in 0) and (<= in 10) always is a chain of \">\" comparisons on nested (- in 1) repeated increasing times.\n\nFrom the examples it appears that the number of these nested (>) statements after the initial two constraints is always 8 (10 - 2).

"<think>  \nLet's analyze the pattern in the examples given.\n\nFor each N, the constraint is expressed as a nested series of `(and ...)` clauses, each applying `(not (= inX t))` and `(< inX t)` for some variables inX.\n\nExamining the examples:\n\n- N=1:\n  `(assert (and (not (= in0 t)) (< in0 t)))`\n  \n- N=2:\n  `(assert (and (and (and (not (= in0 t)) (< in0 t)) (not (= in1 t))) (< in1

(and (and (and (not (= in3 t)) (< in3 t)) (not (= in5 t))) (< in5 t)) (not (= in6 t))) (< in6 t)))`\n\nThere is definitely a pattern in the indices:\n\nFor N=1, the indices are in0\n\nFor N=2, the indices are in0, in1\n\nFor N=3, the indices are in1, in2\n\nFor N=4, the indices are in1, in2, in3\n\nFor N=5, the indices are in2, in3, in4\n\nFor N=7, the indices are in3, in5, in6\n\nBut this looks inconsistent at first sight.\n\nLet's summarize the variables used for each N:\n\n- N=1 => in0\n\n- N=2 => in0, in1\n\n- N=3 => in1, in2\n\n- N=4 => in1, in2, in3\n\n- N=5 => in2, in3, in4\n\n- N=7 => in3, in5, in6\n\nNotice that for N=3, the variables considered were in1, in2 (two variables, but N=3).\n\nFor N=4, indices: in1, in2, in3 (three variables)\n\nFor N=5, indices: in2, in3, in4 (three variables)\n\nFor N=7, indices: in3, in5, in6 (three variables)\n\nIt doesn't look like the number of variables is directly equal to N or N-1.\n\nInstead, it appears as if the pattern is recursive or skips some variables or starts at some index based on N.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial examples given have some inconsistencies or typos in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, the number of variables considered is N-1 for the first two examples, but beyond that it is inconsistent.\n\nLet's try to directly identify the rule for choosing the inX variables for the constraints.\n\nBetween the pairs (not (= inX t)) and (< inX t), always per variable X.\n\nIt seems the nested structure is always approximating:\n\n(assert (and ...)) containing pairs `(not (= inX t))` and `(< inX t)` for a certain set of indices.\n\nCount how many (not (= inX t)) and (< inX t) clauses are there for each N:\n\n- N=1: 1 variable (in0)\n\n- N=2: 2 variables (in0, in1)\n\n- N=3: 2 variables (in1, in2)\n\n- N=4: 3 variables (in1, in2, in3)\n\n- N=5: 3 variables (in2, in3, in4)\n\n- N=7: 3 variables (in3, in5, in6)\n\nAt first, for small N (1 and 2), then 3, 4, 5, 7 it's not a straightforward sequence.\n\nLooking at the difference N minus the minimum index:\n\nAt N=1: min index = 0 => difference 1-0=1\n\nN=2: min index 0 => difference 2-0=2\n\nN=3: min index 1 => difference 3-1=2\n\nN=4: min index 1 => difference 4-1=3\n\nN=5: min index 2 => difference 5-2=3\n\nN=7: min index 3 => difference 7-3=4\n\nSince the examples overlap and the question is under-specified or inconsistent with indices, let's try to infer a method that can generate the formula for N=13 fitting the pattern:\n\n- The constraint is a nested `and` of pairs `(not (= inX t))` and `(< inX t)`\n\n- The number of pairs corresponds roughly to the number of variables considered, which appears close to N-1.\n\nLet's assume for N=13, the indices are from in6 to in12 (covering 7 variables), matching the roughly middle indices.\n\nOr based on the examples for N=7 start at in3 (which is roughly N/2), for N=13, half is 6, so start at in6\n\nThen the variables are in6, in7, in8, in9, in10, in11, in12 (7 variables)\n\nTherefore, the formula for N=13 is:\n\n(assert (and  \n                (not (= in6 t)) (< in6 t)  \n                (not (= in7 t)) (< in7 t)  \n                (not (= in8 t)) (< in8 t)  \n                (not (= in9 t)) (< in9 t)  \n                (not (= in10 t)) (< in10 t)  \n                (not (= in11 t)) (< in11 t)  \n                (not (= in12 t)) (< in12 t)  \n        ))\n\nAlso, it's stated \"All per-variable constraints must be combined using a top-level (assert (and ...)) clause,\" so only one top-level (and ...), not nested and's.\n\nTherefore, the final form is:\n\n(assert (and  \n    (not (= in6 t)) (< in6 t)  \n    (not (= in7 t)) (< in7 t)  \n    (not (= in8 t)) (< in8 t)  \n    (not (= in9 t)) (< in9 t)  \n    (not (= in10 t)) (< in10 t)  \n    (not (= in11 t)) (< in11 t)  \n    (not (= in12 t)) (< in12 t)  \n))\n\nThis matches the pattern of asserting for N variables the corresponding constraints on variables from inX to inX+(N-1) with each variable having the two constraints.\n\nSince the example for N=7 starts at in3 and uses 3 variables (in3, in5, in6) but those indices skip in4.\n\nGiven the complexity in the examples and instruction that all constraints must be combined with a top-level (and ..), I will provide the canonical SMT-LIB format accordingly.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (not (= in6 t)) (< in6 t) (not (= in7 t))

[23..23]\n\nSplit 24..26(3 elements) into [24..25], [26..26]\n\nLevel 4:\n\nFor pairs or singletons, we just add direct <= constraints.\n\n---\n\nI will represent constraints for each base group:\n\n- For a group of size 2:\n\n( <= inX inY )\n\n- For a group of size 3:\n\ne.g. indices a,b,c:\n\n(<= in a in b), (<= in a in c), (<= in b in c)\n\n- For size 4:\n\nwe rely on N=4 example pattern to produce constraints:\n\nLook at N=4 example again:\n\n(assert (and (and (and  ( <=  in0 in1)  ( <=  in2 in3))  ( <=  in0 in2))  ( <=  in1 in2)))\n\nSo for 4 elements a,b,c,d:\n\n- ( <= a b )\n\n- ( <= c d )\n\n- ( <= a c )\n\n- ( <= b c )\n\nSimilarly for 3 elements a,b,c (like N=3):\n\n(<= a b), (<= a c), (<= b c)\n\nSo now implement constraints for these small groups at level 4, then merge recursively levels above.\n\n---\n\nProceeding bottom up:\n\nLevel 4 groups:\n\n- [0..1]: (<= in0 in1)\n\n- [2..3]: (<= in2 in3)\n\n- [4..5]: (<= in4 in5)\n\n- [6..6] single element, no constraints\n\n- [7..8]: (<= in7 in8)\n\n- [9..10]: (<= in9 in10)\n\n- [11..12]: (<= in11 in12)\n\n- [13..13] single element\n\n- [14..15]: (<= in14 in15)\n\n- [16..17]: (<= in16 in17)\n\n- [18..19]: (<= in18 in19)\n\n- [20..20] single\n\n- [21..22]: (<= in21 in22)\n\n- [23..23] single\n\n- [24..25]: (<= in24 in25)\n\n- [26..26] single\n\nLevel 3 merging these into groups of size 3 or 4:\n\n- [0..3]: four elements\n\nWe saw N=4 example constraints:\n\n(<= in0 in1), (<= in2 in3), (<= in0 in2), (<= in1 in2)\n\nSo already have these from level 4 plus merging:\n\n(<= in0 in1), (<= in2 in3), (<= in0 in2), (<= in1 in2)\n\n- [4..6]: three elements (4,5,6)\n\nApply N=3 style:\n\n(<= 4 5), (<= 4 6), (<= 5 6)\n\nWe have (<= 4 5) from level 4 and need to add (<= 4 6), (<= 5 6)\n\nSimilarly for other groups of 3:\n\n- [11..13]:\n\n(11,12,13) (<=11 12), (<=11 13), (<=12 13)\n\n- [18..20]:\n\n(18,19,20) similar\n\n- [21..23]:\n\n(21,22,23) similar\n\n- [24..26]:\n\n(24,25,26) similar\n\n- [7..10]: four elements\n\nSame pattern as for N=4 group:\n\n(<= 7 8), (<= 9 10), (<= 7 9), (<= 8 9)\n\n- [14..17]: four elements\n\n(<= 14 15), (<= 16 17), (<= 14 16), (<= 15 16)\n\nLevel 2 merges:\n\nMerge [0..3] and [4..6] into [0..6] (7 elements)\n\nFor 7 elements, pattern is roughly:\n\n- First sort [0..3] and [4..6]\n\n- Merge via constraints ensuring for i in first half and j in second half:\n\n(<= in i in j)\n\nIn examples, for N=7 elements split into (4,3), the following constraints occur:\n\nE.g., in N=7 example (in N=16 or N=19), they apply constraints of the form:\n\n- (<= in a in b) where a in left half, b in right half\n\n- plus constraints to maintain order inside halves\n\nSo for [0..6]:\n\nKeep previous inside constraints + add:\n\n- (<= in0 in4), (<= in1 in4), (<= in2 in4), (<= in3 in4), (<= in0 in5), (<= in1 in5), (<= in2 in5), (<= in3 in5), (<= in0 in6), (<= in1 in6), (<= in2 in6), (<= in3 in6)\n\nSimilarly for (7..13):\n\nSplit into (7..10) [4 elements] and (11..13) [3 elements], merge with constraints same way:\n\nAdd constraints:\n\n(<= in7 in11), (<= in8 in11), (<= in9 in11), (<= in10 in11), (<= in7 in12), (<= in8 in12), (<= in9 in12), (<= in10 in12), (<= in7 in13), (<= in8 in13), (<= in9 in13), (<= in10 in13)\n\nSimilarly for right half (14..26):\n\nSplit into (14..20):\n\nSplit into (14..17) and (18..20)\n\nmerge constraints between these two subgroups:\n\nAdd:\n\n(<= in14 in18), (<= in15 in18), (<= in16 in18), (<= in17 in18), (<= in14 in19), (<= in15 in19), (<= in16 in19), (<= in17 in19), (<= in14 in20), (<= in15 in20), (<= in16 in20), (<= in17 in20)\n\nAnd (21..26):\n\nsplit into (21..23) and (24..26)\n\nmerge constraints:\n\n(<= in21 in24), (<= in22 in24), (<= in23 in24), (<= in21 in25), (<= in22 in25), (<= in23 in25), (<= in21 in26), (<= in22 in26), (<= in23 in26)\n\nLevel 1 merges:\n\nMerge (0..6) and (7..13) into (0..13) - 14 elements\n\nAdd merging constraints:\n\nFor all i in 0..6 and j in 7..13:\n\n(<= in i in j)\n\nLevel 1 merge of (14..20) and (21..26) into (14..26):\n\nAdd:\n\nFor all i in 14..20, j in 21..26:\n\n(<= in i in j)\n\nLevel 0 merge:\n\nMerge (0..13) and (14..26)\n\nAdd:\n\nFor all i in 0..13, j in 14..26:\n\n(<= in i in j)\n\n---\n\nNow the final constraint to be output is:\n\n(assert (and <nested and>))\n\nWhere each (<= inX inY) is a leaf expression.\n\nThe nested and structure is left-deep nested and combining two constraints or two and expressions at a time.\n\nNote from examples the nesting is very deep for large N.\n\nConsidering the very long output, the method is:\n\n- Gather all pairwise constraints as per above\n\n- Sort constraints lex order (by inX then inY)\n\n- Nest conjunctions left-associatively by combining pairs with (and ... ...)\n\n- Then wrap all in (assert ...)\n\n---\n\nNow, list all constraints explicitly (enumeration only):\n\n**Base groups constraints (small groups) (3 or 4 elements), as per examples**\n\nLevel 4:\n\nPairs:\n\n- (<= in0 in1)\n\n- (<= in2 in3)\n\n- (<= in4 in5)\n\n- (<= in7 in8)\n\n- (<= in9 in10)\n\n- (<= in11 in12)\n\n- (<= in14 in15)\n\n- (<= in16 in17)\n\n- (<= in18 in19)\n\n- (<= in21 in22)\n\n- (<= in24 in25)\n\nOther singletons no constraints.\n\nLevel 3:\n\n3-element groups constraints (N=3 style):\n\n(0..3) partially done (4 elements) handled by N=4 style\n\n(4..6): (<= 4 5), (<= 4 6), (<= 5 6), (<=4 5) was added above, so add (<= 4 6), (<= 5 6)\n\nSimilarly others:\n\n- (11..13): (<= 11 12), (<= 11 13), (<= 12 13) (12 13) missing from base? Add these.\n\n- (18..20): (<=18 19), (<=18 20), (<=19 20)\n\n- (21..23): (<=21 22), (<=21 23), (<=22 23)\n\n- (24..26): (<=24 25), (<=24 26), (<=25 26)\n\n- (7..10): N=4 style:\n\n(<=7 8), (<=9 10), (<=7 9), (<=8 9) (<=7 8) and (<=9 10) from base exist, add (<= 7 9), (<=8 9)\n\n- (14..17) N=4 style:\n\n(<=14 15), (<=16 17) base exist, add (<=14 16), (<=15 16)\n\nLevel 2 merges:\n\n- Merge (0..3) and (4..6):\n\nAdd cross group constraints:\n\nFor i in 0..3 and j in 4..6:\n\n(<= in0 in4), (<= in0 in5), (<= in0 in6)\n\n(<= in1 in4), (<= in1 in5), (<= in1 in6)\n\n(<= in2 in4), (<= in2 in5), (<= in2 in6)\n\n(<= in3 in4), (<= in3 in5), (<= in3 in6)\n\nLevel 2 merges:\n\n- Merge (7..10) and (11..13):\n\nFor i in 7..10 and j in 11..13:\n\n(<= in7 in11), (<= in7 in12), (<= in7 in13)\n\n(<= in8 in11), (<= in8 in12), (<= in8 in13)\n\n(<= in9 in11), (<= in9 in12), (<= in9 in13)\n\n(<= in10 in11), (<= in10 in12), (<= in10 in13)\n\n- Merge (14..17) and (18..20):\n\nFor i in 14..17 and j in 18..20:\n\n(<= in14 in18), (<= in14 in19), (<= in14 in20)\n\n(<= in15 in18), (<= in15 in19), (<= in15 in20)\n\n(<= in16 in18), (<= in16 in19), (<= in16 in20)\n\n(<= in17 in18), (<= in17 in19), (<= in17 in20)\n\n- Merge (21..23) and (24..26):\n\nFor i in 21..23 and j in 24..26:\n\n(<= in21 in24), (<= in21 in25), (<= in21 in26)\n\n(<= in22 in24), (<= in22 in25), (<= in22 in26)\n\n(<= in23 in24), (<= in23 in25), (<= in23 in26)\n\nLevel 1 merges:\n\n- Merge (0..6) and (7..13):\n\nFor i in 0..6, j in 7..13:\n\nAll pairs of (<= in i in j) for i=0..6, j=7..13\n\n- Merge (14..20) and (21..26): i in 14..20, j in 21..26\n\nLevel 0 merge:\n\n- Merge (0..13) and (14..26):\n\nFor i in 0..13 and j in 14..26:\n\n---\n\nAll constraints listed, now output SMT-LIB canonical form:\n\n- For each (<= inX inY), write:\n\n( <=  inX inY)\n\nSpaces are as example: one space between tokens.\n\nFinally wrap with:\n\n(assert (and ...))\n\nand nested left-associative ands.\n\nThe full nesting will be very large due to many constraints.\n\n---\n\nBecause the problem states to output only the constraint string, no commentary, in exact canonical SMT-LIB format as in the examples, I will prepare the final string.\n\nNote the example has many nested (and (... ) (...)) pairs, fully left-nested.\n\nI will produce the minimal code that meets the format using the exact style:\n\n\"(assert (and <nested ands>))\"\n\nWhere each and nests two things only (either constraints or nested ands).\n\n---\n\nDue to the very large number of constraints for N=27 (hundreds), providing exact canonical nested form as a continuous expression is more practical with an automated script, however as I must produce it here, I will produce it with a programmatic approach to produce this nested form in strict form.\n\nFor system purposes, I will output the final SMT-LIB as per instructions.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and

in16), ..., (<= in15 in16), ..., (<= in0 in1)\n\nI will write code in my mind to generate the nested expression:\n\nStart with the first clause as current_expr.\n\nFor each next clause, current_expr = (and current_expr clause)\n\nAt the end, wrap with (assert current_expr)\n\nBecause the SMT-LIB format requires no extra parentheses than those to represent the logic, and the examples show nested

the examples.\n\nWe must nest the `(and ...)` clauses exactly as shown in the examples.\n\nThe examples show that nesting is done by recursively wrapping pairs like `(and constraint1 constraint2)`, then nesting those `(and ...)` clauses together, building up to the top-level `assert`.\n\nThus, we will build the constraints as a big nested chain of `(and X Y)` from left to right:\n\nExample for

cumbersome, the examples use nested `(and ...)` where each `(and a b)` contains two sub-clauses.\n\nWe will reproduce the exact style as in the examples, especially preserving the spacing exactly as shown, e.g., `(not ( = in0 65))  ( =  in0 66)` with spacing after `( =` and so on.\n\nFollowing the given formatting:\n\n- Each individual constraint is either `(not ( = inX V))` or `(=  inX V)` with spaces following the pattern.\n- For each index, two constraints combined with `(and ...)`\n- All combined with nested `(and ...)` pairs with appropriate spaces.\n\nWe'll produce the full SMT-LIB

The initial (>=) and (<=) are on 'in 0'.\n\nSince everything is always wrapped in 10 nested \"and\"s, flatterned with 10 clauses inside each nesting, but ultimately only 10 constraints each time:\n\n- One on in 0 (>= 0)\n- One on in 0 (<= 10)\n- One ( > in 1)\n- And then seven more ( > ...) nested subtraction constraints on (in 1)\n\nIn total, for all Ns seen, we have the same number of constraints: 10.\n\nHence, for N=16, by the pattern, it will be the same constraint as N=10.\n\nSo the output is the same assertion as the one for N=10, exactly.\n\nWe must produce the SMTLIB assertion without any commentary or extraneous formatting.\n\nNote that the nested (and ...) are required.\n\nI will produce it exactly as given for N=10.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  (>= in 0)  (<= in 10))  (> in 1))  (> (- in 1) 1))  (> (- (- in 1) 1) 1))  (> (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1))  (> (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  (> (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)))</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1776, "completion_tokens": 861, "total_tokens": 2637, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

No - in all examples, the outer `and` is repeated 10 times.\n\nSo the number of nested `and`s is always 10 at the top level?\n\nFrom examples:\n\nAt N=2:\n\n`(assert (and (and ... (and (and (and ...`\n\nCounting parens is complicated but inside the `(assert (and ...))` there are 10 `(and)` conjunctions at the top level, each containing one atomic predicate. The nesting is to ensure 10 conjuncts combined.\n\nThe 10 conjuncts for every N=2..7 are:\n\n1. `(>= in0 0)`\n2. `(<= in0 10)`\n3. `(> in1 1)`\n4-10. The nested `(> (- ... ) 1)` 7 times, each subtracting 1 deeper from `in1`.\n\nSo total 10 conjuncts in the (and ...).\n\nTherefore, the constraints do not change with N in the example given - all the examples from N=2 to N=7 repeat the same pattern with 10 conjuncts where the first two relate to `in0` and the next 8 nested `(> ...)` relate to `in1`.\n\nSo for N=15, we need to find the pattern: for N=2..7 the number of conjuncts is fixed 10.\n\nPerhaps the question expects us to extend to more conjuncts for larger N.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the number of nested `(> (- ... ) 1)` is always N+8 or some function.\n\nBut the examples for N=2..7 have all the same number of conjuncts (10).\n\nAlternatively, maybe N does not affect the formula, only the top-level number of variables or constraints.\n\nBut given the problem statement (\"All per-variable constraints must be combined ...\").\n\nGiven the examples use only variables `in0` and `in1`, with constraints on `in0` and repeated nested constraints on `in1`, the problem might be simplified to always the same constraints regardless of N (at least for the provided examples).\n\nHence, for N=15, keep the same constraint structure with (>= in0 0), (<= in0 10) , and 10 nested constraints on in1.\n\nBut the problem specifically says \"Given the following examples of constraints for increasing input sizes\", implying the examples correspond to increasing N.\n\nEach example has the same constraints, so the question is what is the constraint for N=15?\n\nGiven the pattern is fixed with 10 conjuncts, no change with N, the answer is the same as examples given.\n\nHowever, it's suspicious because the problem states it is \"for increasing input sizes\" and \"all per-variable constraints must be combined using a top-level (assert (and ...)) clause.\"\n\nSo maybe the problem is that the nested constraints are always 10 of them for variable `in1`, besides the constraints on `in0`.\n\nSince only `in0` and `in1` appear, the N in the examples in the prompt might be unrelated to the number of variables or constraints.\n\nAlternatively, the problem as stated might be a trick - keep the exact same constraint pattern shown for N=15.\n\nGiven the requirement to provide the constraint with all per-variable constraints combined with a top-level assert (and), and the constraint string to be in exact canonical SMT-LIB format without extra commentary.\n\nSo, final answer:\n\n```\n(assert (and (>= in0 0) (<= in0 10)\n  (> in1 1)\n  (> (- in1 1) 1)\n  (> (- (- in1 1) 1) 1)\n  (> (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1)\n  (> (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)\n  (> (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)\n  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)\n  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)\n  (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)\n))\n```\n\nBut the prompt requires strict canonical SMT-LIB format and also an `and` nested as shown in the examples.\n\nExamples use nested `(and (and ... ) ...)` to combine all 10 conjuncts.\n\nI will produce the result in exactly the same style as the examples, replacing the label inN with `in0` and `in1` correctly used, same nesting.\n\nThe nested `(and ... )` of 10 conjuncts.\n\nI will write that replacing the last example (N=7) replacing `N=15`.\n\nThe only constraint is that the final constraint has 10 conjuncts combined with a chain of nested `(and)` as shown.\n\nHence, the answer.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (>= in0 0) (<= in0 10)) (> in1 1)) (> (- in1 1) 1)) (> (- (- in1 1) 1) 1)) (> (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1)) (> (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)) (> (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)) (> (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)) (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)) (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in1 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)))\n</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1776, "completion_tokens": 1851, "total_tokens": 3627, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_79b79be41f"}}, "error": null}

Each example shows the constraints as nested `(and ...)` with binary inequalities that enforce a certain ordering among the inputs `in0` to `in(N-1)`.\n\nLooking carefully at the examples, especially for larger N like 16, 18, 19, 23, the pattern is constructed by recursively subdividing the input variables into roughly equal parts, then asserting ordering constraints within each part and then between parts. The constraints resemble those coming from a sorting network or some form of recursive merge sort orderings:\n\n- The variables are split into groups (usually halves or thirds),\n- The ordering within groups is enforced recursively,\n- Then ordering relations connect the groups to maintain global ordering.\n\nThe pattern is not strictly simple ascending chain constraints `(<= in0 in1) (<= in1 in2) ...` but rather a hierarchical merging style with ordering constraints ensuring merges.\n\nGiven the previous examples for large N and how constraints are structured, the constraints for N=30 will likely be formed by:\n\n1. Splitting the set into smaller subsets.\n2. Recursively asserting constraints within these subsets.\n3. Adding constraints to merge and order across subsets.\n\nDue to the prompt context, the final output must be the entire constraint for N=30 in canonical SMT-LIB form with no extra commentary.\n\nHowever, the examples don't explicitly show N=30, so I must extrapolate the pattern.\n\nTo produce the correct canonical `(assert (and ...))` for N=30, let's analyze what the pattern looks like with the existing large N examples.\n\n### Observations from existing examples:\n- For powers of two or close (N=16, N=18), the constraints cover:\n  - ordering within pairs: `(<= in0 in1) (<= in2 in3)` etc.\n  - ordering spanning blocks: `(<= in0 in4) (<= in0 in8)` etc.\n- For N=23, similarly, constraints are built by:\n  - ordering pairs within blocks: `(<= in0 in1)`, `(<= in3 in4)`, `(<= in6 in7)`, `(<= in9 in10)`, `(<= in12 in13)...`\n  - then ordering across groups `(<= in0 in3)`, `(<= in6 in9)`, `(<= in12 in15)` etc.\n- The constraints combine to build a partial order that corresponds to a merge tree or sorting network steps.\n\nThe pattern appears to be a merge of three levels or more:\n\n- Level 1: pairwise ordering within pairs `(<= inX inY)` where X and Y differ by 1 or a small offset.\n- Level 2: ordering between these pair groups, roughly quarter sections or thirds.\n- Level 3: ordering merging these bigger groups.\n\n### For N=30\n\nI will try to replicate the pattern similarly as for N=23 or N=19.\n\nLet's find the pairs:\n\n- Pairs (in0,in1), (in2,in3), (in4,in5), ..., up to in28,in29.\n  So from 0 to 29 stepping by 2: (<= in0 in1), (<= in2 in3), (<= in4 in5), ..., (<= in28 in29)\n\nThen order within quarters or roughly sub-blocks:\n\n- Subsets of 10 (because 30/3=10), so for the three main blocks: in0..in9, in10..in19, in20..in29.\n- Apply ordering constraints across these blocks similar to merges:\n\nWithin block 0..9: recursively use a similar pattern as for N=10.\n\nWithin block 10..19: similarly N=10 constraints applied to in10..in19.\n\nWithin block 20..29: similarly N=10 constraints applied to in20..in29.\n\nThen impose constraints merging these three blocks:\n\n- Merge block0 with block1:\n\n  For example, constraints ensuring `in0 <= in10`, `in1 <= in10`, ..., `in9 <= in10` and similar.\n\n- Merge block1 with block2:\n\n  Constraints ensuring `in10 <= in20`, `in11 <= in20`, ..., `in19 <= in20`.\n\nThis is a generalization of the provided pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Pairwise constraints within each block of 10:\n\nFrom example N=10:\n\n```\n ( <=  in0 in1)  ( <=  in0 in2))  ( <=  in1 in2))  ( <=  in3 in4))\n ( <=  in0 in3))  ( <=  in1 in3))  ( <=  in2 in3))  ( <=  in5 in6))\n ( <=  in5 in7))  ( <=  in6 in7))  ( <=  in8 in9))  ( <=  in5 in8))\n ( <=  in6 in8))  ( <=  in7 in8))  ( <=  in0 in5))  ( <=  in1 in5))\n ( <=  in2 in5))  ( <=  in3 in5))  ( <=  in4 in5)))\n```\n\nFor block 0..9, variables are `in0` to `in9`, for block 1: `in10`..`in19` (offset +10), block 2: `in20..in29` (offset +20).\n\nSo for each block, replicate the pattern, adding offset:\n\n- Block0: in0..in9 as is from N=10 pattern.\n\n- Block1: in10..in19 add +10 offset to all variable indices.\n\n- Block2: in20..in29 add +20 offset.\n\n### Step 2: Merging the blocks:\n\nFrom examples like N=23 and N=19, when merging bigger blocks, the pattern enforces `(<= inX inY)` for all or partial cross block indices to guarantee ordering, like `(<= in0 in12), (<= in1 in12), ... (<= in11 in12)` in N=23 where block boundaries are at 12.\n\nFor N=30 split into three blocks of 10, I will have cross-constraints:\n\n- For all i in 0..9 and for block1 start index =10: `(<= in_i in_10)`\n\n- Similarly for merging block1 (in10..19) and block2 (in20..29), `(<= in_i in_20)` for i in 10..19\n\nAlso, recursively, possibly partial merges inside blocks, but the available examples cluster in the above style.\n\n---\n\n### Final constraint construction:\n\nThe canonical format is `(assert (and ...))` with nested `and`s.\n\nThe provided patterns use nested `(and ...)` chaining from left to right.\n\nI will construct the binary inequalities for N=30, nesting them all into a big `(and ...)`.\n\n---\n\n### Outline of pairs:\n\nFor block 0 (in0..in9):\n\n- `(<= in0 in1) (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2) (<= in3 in4) (<= in0 in3) (<= in1 in3) (<= in2 in3) (<= in5 in6) (<= in5 in7)` `(<= in6 in7) (<= in8 in9) (<= in5 in8) (<= in6 in8) (<= in7 in8) (<= in0 in5) (<= in1 in5) (<= in2 in5) (<= in3 in5) (<= in4 in5)`\n\nSame for block 1 (offset +10):\n\n- `(<= in10 in11) (<= in10 in12) (<= in11 in12) (<= in13 in14) (<= in10 in13) (<= in11 in13) (<= in12 in13) (<= in15 in16) (<= in15 in17) (<= in16 in17) (<= in18 in19) (<= in15 in18) (<= in16 in18) (<= in17 in18) (<= in10 in15) (<= in11 in15) (<= in12 in15) (<= in13 in15) (<= in14 in15)`\n\nBlock 2 (offset +20):\n\n- `(<= in20 in21) (<= in20 in22) (<= in21 in22) (<= in23 in24) (<= in20 in23) (<= in21 in23) (<= in22 in23) (<= in25 in26) (<= in25 in27) (<= in26 in27) (<= in28 in29) (<= in25 in28) (<= in26 in28) (<= in27 in28) (<= in20 in25) (<= in21 in25) (<= in22 in25) (<= in23 in25) (<= in24 in25)`\n\n-----\n\n### Cross-block constraints merging these three blocks:\n\nFrom examples N=23:\n\n- For merging block0 and block1 (indices 0..9 and 10..19), constraints are of the form:\n\n  `(<= in0 in10) (<= in1 in10) ...

(( < ch0 97) ( >= ch0 65)) ( <= ch0 90)) ... ))\n\nFor N=20, we will have these constraints for ch0 through ch19.\n\nThe expression is a nesting of (and ... (and ... (...))), with one (and ...) wrapping two constraints per variable:\nWe see the existing pattern at N=14 clearly matches (14*3) constraints nested inside a big (assert (and ...)).\n\nWhile the original examples use deeply nested (and ... (and ...)) rather than flat (and ...), the final requirement asks for all constraints combined in a top-level (assert (and ...)) clause, so I will replicate the exact nested form as per the examples.\n\nTherefore, for N=20, we'll have (assert (and ... )) with a chain of nested and's, each introducing constraints for one variable (3 per variable).\n\nOrdering per variable: ( < chi 97), ( >= chi 65), ( <= chi 90)\n\nNumber of nested \"and\"s we see is increasing rapidly as in N=14 example, so for N=20, it will be nested 20*3 nested and's (really 20 * 1 \"and\"s that contain the 3 constraints). The examples show that per variable, the 3 constraints are wrapped in an (and ( < ... ) ( >= ... )) ( <= ... ), meaning the \"and\" is nested multiple times.\n\nBut looking carefully, the example like N=2:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and \n  ( <  ch0 97)  ( >=  ch0 65))  ( <=  ch0 90))  \n  ( <  ch1 97))  ( >=  ch1 65))  ( <=  ch1 90)))\n\nHere for ch0: (and (and (< ch0 97) (>= ch0 65)) (<= ch0 90))\nThen ch1 similarly wrapped with nested ands.\n\nSo effectively for each ch_i, the pattern is:\n\n(and (and (< chi 97) (>= chi 65)) (<= chi 90))\n\nThe entire constraints for all variables are nested inside one large giant (assert (and ...)), with these and's nested one after another.\n\nTherefore for N=20, we have exactly 20 sets of:\n\n(and (and (< ch_i 97) (>= ch_i 65)) (<= ch_i 90))\n\nNested one after another inside a big (assert (and ...))\n\nBecause multiple \"and\"s are nested inside, the number of nested \"and\" expressions grows a lot.\n\nI will replicate the pattern accordingly.\n\nSo for N=20:\n\n(assert (and \n  (and (and (< ch0 97) (>= ch0 65)) (<= ch0 90))\n  (and (and (< ch1 97) (>= ch1 65)) (<= ch1 90))\n  ...\n  (and (and (< ch19 97) (>= ch19 65)) (<= ch19 90))\n))\n\nBut the examples show these are nested deeply, i.e. (and (and (and ...))). According to the pattern, the nested \"and\" sequence follows:\n\nE.g. for N=2:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and\n  ( <  ch0 97)  ( >=  ch0 65))  ( <=  ch0 90))\n  ( <  ch1 97))  ( >=  ch1 65))  ( <=  ch1 90)))\n\nWe can count the number of \"and\"s for N=2 is 6.\n\nIt looks like for every single atomic constraint, we have an \"and\" wrapping it with others. So total 3 constraints per variable, each wrapped inside nested \"and\"s.\n\nThis pattern corresponds to just flattening like:\n\n(assert (and \n  ( <  ch0 97)  ( >=  ch0 65)  ( <=  ch0 90)\n  ( <  ch1 97)  ( >=  ch1 65)  ( <=  ch1 90)\n))\n\nBut the example is more nested.\n\nGiven the user's insistence on exact canonical SMT-LIB format and showing the pattern as in the example, I will replicate the deeply nested pattern of \"and\" as in N=14 example.\n\nNote:\n- For each variable, 3 constraints wrapped inside two nested and's:\n  (and (and (< chi 97) (>= chi 65)) (<= chi 90))\n\n- Then the variables' constraints are nested inside a big (assert (and (...))).\n\n- The nesting is exact as shown: the first variable's 3 constraints wrapped in (and (and ...)), then the second variable's 3 constraints wrapped in (and (and ...)) it seems wrapped as a third argument to the parent and, leading to nested and's.\n\nConclusion: For N=20, the pattern will be:\n\n(assert (and [this deep nested chain of (and (and (< ch_i 97) (>= ch_i 65)) (<= ch_i 90))]))\n\nwith each variable constraint nested inside the previous using \"and\".\n\nThis can be implemented as:\n\nStart from the last variable's constraints:\n\nand_i = (and (and (< ch_i 97) (>= ch_i 65)) (<= ch_i 90))\n\nThen for i = N-1 down to 0:\n\nand_all = (and and_i and_all) \n\nBut since SMT-LIB and in the examples, all nesting is left associative starting from the leftmost: so the overall (assert (and <chain>)).\n\nBut precisely, from the user's examples, the nesting is very deep and linear, each and containing one variable's 3 constraints, and the next variable's constraints are added via (and ...).\n\nHence final form is nested (and ... (and ... ))\n\nI will implement in code for correctness.\n\nVariables: ch0 .. ch19\n\nConstraints for ch_i:\n\n  (and (and (< ch_i 97) (>= ch_i 65)) (<= ch_i 90))\n\nNesting all constraints for i from 0 to 19 inside nested and's as in example.\n\nAt the end wrap with (assert ... )\n\nThat will produce exactly the pattern.\n\nNo extra commentary in constraint string.\n\nNo extra whitespace besides minimal to match the examples.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and ( <  ch0 97)  ( >=  ch0 65))  ( <=  ch0 90))  ( <  ch1 97))  ( >=  ch1 65))  ( <=  ch1 90))  ( <  ch2 97))  ( >=  ch2 65))  ( <=  ch2 90))  ( <  ch3 97))  ( >=  ch3 65))  ( <=  ch3 90))  ( <  ch4 97))  ( >=  ch4 65))  ( <=  ch4 90))  ( <  ch5 97))  ( >=  ch5 65))  ( <=  ch5 90))  ( <  ch6 97))  ( >=  ch6 65))  ( <=  ch6 90))  ( <  ch7 97))  ( >=  ch7 65))  ( <=  ch7 90))  ( <  ch8 97))  ( >=  ch8 65))  ( <=  ch8 90))  ( <  ch9 97))  ( >=  ch9 65))  ( <=  ch9 90))  ( <  ch10 97))  ( >=  ch10 65))  ( <=  ch10 90))  ( <  ch11 97))  ( >=  ch11 65))  ( <=  ch11 90))  ( <  ch12 97))  ( >=  ch12 65))  ( <=  ch12 90))  ( <  ch13 97))  ( >=  ch13 65))  ( <=  ch13 90))  ( <  ch14 97))  ( >=  ch14 65))  ( <=  ch14 90))  ( <  ch15 97))  ( >=  ch15 65))  ( <=  ch15 90))  ( <  ch16 97))  ( >=  ch16 65))  ( <=  ch16 90))  ( <  ch17 97))  ( >=  ch17 65))  ( <=  ch17 90))  ( <  ch18 97))  ( >=  ch18 65))  ( <=  ch18 90))  ( <  ch19 97))  ( >=  ch19 65))  ( <=  ch19 90)))</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2876, "completion_tokens": 2120, "total_tokens": 4996, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

(and \n      ...\n        (and ( >= in1 in0) ( > in1 in0))\n        (and ( >= in2 in0) ( > in2 in0))\n      ...\n    )\n  )\n))\n```\n\nwith all pairs nested inside.\n\nTherefore, the production is to enumerate all `( >= in{i} in{j})` and `( > in{i} in{j})` for i=1..23 and j=0..i-1, paired and nested.\n\nDue to the problem statement and examples, I will present the SMT-LIB clause fully nested, exactly following the pattern.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and

For a triple in0..in2:\n\n (<= in0 in1), (<= in0 in2), (<= in1 in2)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThen merge groups, for example, group 0 and group 1 merged, adding comparison constraints to order group 0 inputs <= group 1 inputs.\n\nSimilarly for others, merging groups pairwise.\n\nOverall, the pattern is:\n- Create ordering constraints within each group (triples)\n- Then merge groups pairwise by constraints ordering inputs of one group <= inputs of the other group\n- Then merge resulting groups again, until the entire set is ordered\n\nThis yields a full partial order respecting merging hierarchy.\n\nFinal combined constraint is a deeply nested (assert (and ...)).\n\nThe exact structure of nesting is similar:\n\n(assert \n  (and \n    (and\n      ...)\n    ...)\n\nwhere each \"and\" contains a set of <= constraints or nested and.\n\nFollowing this pattern, but the exact output is long and repetitive.\n\nGiven the complexity, the best way to produce the exact SMT-LIB is by following the group merges stepwise:\n\nStep 1: for each group (3 elements) create:\n\n  (<=  inX inY)  for pairs (X,Y) with X<Y inside group\n\nStep 2: for each group pair (e.g. group0 and group1) create constraints ordering:\n\n(<= inX inY) for all inX in group0 and inY in group1\n\nStep 3: repeat merging higher groups similarly\n\nStep 4: define the constraints for groups of 3 properly, then for merged groups of 6, then for merged groups of 12, etc.\n\nSince the problem expects the exact SMT-LIB string, I will create the full expression exactly in that style.\n\n---\n\nVariables:\n\nGroups:\n\ng0:  in0, in1, in2\n\ng1:  in3, in4, in5\n\ng2:  in6, in7, in8\n\ng3:  in9, in10, in11\n\ng4:  in12, in13, in14\n\ng5:  in15, in16, in17\n\ng6:  in18, in19, in20\n\ng7:  in21, in22, in23\n\ng8:  in24, in25, in26\n\nWithin group constraints (for 3 vars: i0, i1, i2):\n\n  (<= i0 i1), (<= i0 i2), (<= i1 i2)\n\n---\n\n1) Constraints within groups:\n\n(<= in0 in1) (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2)\n\n(<= in3 in4) (<= in3 in5) (<= in4 in5)\n\n(<= in6 in7) (<= in6 in8) (<= in7 in8)\n\n(<= in9 in10) (<= in9 in11) (<= in10 in11)\n\n(<= in12 in13) (<= in12 in14) (<=

in26)\n\n---\n\n2) Merge these groups in pairs: (g0,g1), (g2,g3), (g4,g5), (g6,g7), then g8 alone.\n\nFor each pair, create <= relations between each element of first group to each element of second group.\n\nExample for (g0,g1):\n\n(<= in0 in3) (<= in1 in3) (<= in2 in3) (<= in0 in4) (<= in1 in4) (<= in2 in4) (<= in0 in5) (<= in1 in5) (<= in2 in5)\n\nSimilarly for other pairs:\n\n(g2,g3):\n\n(<= in6 in9) (<= in7 in9) (<= in8 in9) (<= in6 in10) (<= in7 in10) (<= in8 in10) (<= in6 in11) (<= in7 in11) (<= in8 in11)\n\n(g4,g5):\n\n(<= in12 in15) (<= in13 in15) (<= in14 in15) (<= in12 in16) (<= in13 in16) (<= in14 in16) (<= in12 in17) (<= in13 in17) (<= in14 in17)\n\n(g6,g7):\n\n(<= in18 in21) (<= in19 in21) (<= in20 in21) (<= in18 in22) (<= in19 in22) (<= in20 in22) (<= in18 in23) (<= in19 in23) (<= in20 in23)\n\n---\n\n3) Next merge these merged groups:\n\nLet's group merged groups of 6:\n\nm0: g0+g1 (in0..in5)\n\nm1: g2+g3 (in6..in11)\n\nm2: g4+g5 (in12..in17)\n\nm3: g6+g7 (in18..in23)\n\ng8 alone: (in24..in26)\n\nMerge m0 and m1 => add (<= x y) for every x in m0 and y in m1.\n\n((in0..in5) <= (in6..in11))\n\nSimilarly merge m2 and m3\n\n((in12..in17) <= (in18..in23))\n\n---\n\n4) Merge bigger groups:\n\nNow:\n\nM0 = m0 + m1 (in0..in11)\n\nM1 = m2 + m3 (in12..in23)\n\ng8: in24..in26\n\nMerge M0 and M1:\n\n(in0..in11) <= (in12..in23)\n\nMerge M0+M1 and g8:\n\n(in0..in23) <= (in24..in26)\n\n---\n\n5) Also, note \"within merged groups\" we keep the smaller constraints previously included.\n\n---\n\n6) Finally, add ordering constraints from in0 to all other groups as in previous examples:\n\nWe can see from example N=19, every larger group is constrained also with (<= in0 inX) for X in successor groups.\n\nThis is already included by merging ensure, no special extra constraints needed.\n\n---\n\n7) The nesting will be a tree of and's, each grouping a set of constraints or nested and.\n\n---\n\n8) The final SMT-LIB constraint is a large (assert (and ...)) structure, where inside each and there are further ands or constraints, a \"deeply nested\" and tree with all constraints expressed.\n\n---\n\n9) According to the pattern in the examples, every \"and\" contains two sub-ands or constraints, leading to a left-leaning binary tree of and's nesting.\n\n---\n\nTo format, I need to carefully nest these accordingly.\n\nI will build this structure bottom-up:\n\nLevel 0: atomic constraints (<= ... ...)\n\nLevel 1: group constraints inside groups (3 elements per group)\n\nLevel 2: pairwise merges of groups (3 elements each) \u2192 groups of 6 elements\n\nLevel 3: pairwise merges of groups of 6 elements to 12 elements\n\nLevel 4: merges of 12 elements groups to 24 elements + group 8 (3 elements)\n\nLevel 5: merge all 24 elements + 3 elements = 27\n\n---\n\nLet's build the smallest groups first, for example group 0 (in0..in2):\n\n(and (and (<= in0 in1) (<= in0 in2)) (<= in1 in2))\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNote that every triple group constraints use two nested ands:\n\n(and (and (<= a b) (<= a c)) (<= b c))\n\n---\n\nNow between groups, where constraints are many (e.g., 3*3=9 constraints), I will group them into nested binary and's grouping pairs recursively.\n\nTo keep structure lightweight, I will group constraints in lexicographic order as in the examples, first all constraints between inX and inY with inX in first group and inY in second group.\n\n---\n\nWrite a helper function mentally to encode:\n\n- and-nest: takes a list of constraints and nests into (and x (and y (and z ...)))\n\n---\n\nLet's begin:\n\nGroup constraints (each triple):\n\nG0: (<= in0 in1), (<= in0 in2), (<= in1 in2)\n\nG1: (<= in3 in4), (<= in3 in5), (<= in4 in5)\n\nG2: (<= in6 in7), (<= in6 in8), (<= in7 in8)\n\nG3: (<= in9 in10), (<= in9 in11), (<= in10 in11)\n\nG4: (<= in12 in13), (<= in12 in14), (<= in13 in14)\n\nG5: (<= in15 in16), (<= in15 in17), (<= in16 in17)\n\nG6: (<= in18 in19), (<= in18 in20), (<= in19 in20)\n\nG7: (<= in21 in22), (<= in21 in23), (<= in22 in23)\n\nG8: (<= in24 in25), (<= in24 in26), (<= in25 in26)\n\n---\n\nStep 2: constraints merging group pairs:\n\nFor (G0,G1):\n\n(<= in0 in3) (<= in1 in3) (<= in2 in3) (<= in0 in4) (<= in1 in4) (<= in2 in4) (<= in0 in5) (<= in1 in5) (<= in2 in5)\n\nSimilarly for (G2,G3), (G4,G5), (G6,G7).\n\n---\n\nStep 3: merge (G0+G1) and (G2+G3):\n\nAll <= inX inY where inX from in0..in5, inY from in6..in11.\n\n9 vs 6 variables merged: 6 * 6 = 36 constraints.\n\nSimilarly (G4+G5), (G6+G7).\n\n---\n\nStep 4: merge M0 and M1:\n\n(in0..in11) <= (in12..in23)\n\n12 vs 12 = 144 constraints.\n\nStep 5: merge this with G8 (in24..in26):\n\n(in0..in23) <= (in24..in26)\n\n24 vs 3 = 72 constraints.\n\nTotal constraints large.\n\n---\n\nBecause the examples show leading balancing with deep nested ands to combine constraints, I will follow a structure like:\n\nTop level: assert (and ...)\n\nBreak into nested ands grouping constraints by levels\n\n---\n\nI will produce final output accordingly:\n\n<answer>\n(assert (and\n  ;; Level5 merge (in0..23) <= (24..26)\n  (and\n    ;; Level4 merges\n    (and\n      ;; merge M0 and M1: (0..11)

canonical SMT-LIB format with spacing as shown in examples.\n\nExample of sum construction:\n\nFor sum from in2 to in4:\n(+ in4 (+ in3 in2))\n\nFor sum from in0 to in3:\n(+ in3 (+ in2 (+ in1 in0)))\n\nWe need to write them accordingly.\n\nPlan:\n\n- Construct all range constraints for in0..in13 and t\n- Construct all sums and their not equal constraints\n- Join all with a single assert (and ...)\n\nNumber of input variables: 14\n\nNumber of range constraints: 14 * 2 = 28 plus 2 for t = 30 range constraints\n\nNumber of sum-not-equal constraints: number of pairs (i,j) with 0 <= i <= j <= 13\n\nNumber is sum_{i=0 to 13} (14 - i) = 14 + 13 + ... + 1 = 14*15/2 = 105 constraints\n\nSo total constraints: 30 + 105 = 135\n\nWe need to write them all into one (assert (and ...)).\n\nNow start composing.\n\nVariable names: in0 ... in13, t\n\nFormat spacing example: ( >=  in0 -10), exactly two spaces between parentheses and the operator, etc.\n\nWe will prepare the list:\n\nFirst the range constraints for inputs:\n\n( >=  in0 -10) ( <=  in0 10)\n...\n( >=  in13 -10) ( <=  in13 10)\n\nThen for t:\n\n( >=  t -100) ( <=  t 100)\n\nThen for sums:\n\nFor all 0 <= i <= j <= 13:\n\nSum of in_i ... in_j:\n\nFor i==j:\n\n(not ( = in_i t))\n\nFor j > i:\n\n(not ( = sum t))\n\nwhere sum is nested pluses starting from in_i upwards to in_j.\n\nE.g., for i=0,j=1: (+ in1 in0)\n\ni=0,j=2: (+ in2 (+ in1 in0))\n\nand so on.\n\nWe will proceed to write all constraints in order:\n\n- Range constraints for in_i from i=0 to 13 (ascending order)\n\n- Range constraints for t\n\n- For sums from start=0 to 13, and end from start to 13:\n  - write (not ( = <sum> t))\n\nExamples and formatting have no extra spaces inside nested sums besides necessary spaces.\n\n---\n\nNow writing the final combined assertion.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and  (>= in0 -10)  (<= in0 10)  (>= in1 -10)  (<= in1 10)  (>= in2 -10)  (<= in2 10)  (>= in3 -10)  (<= in3 10)  (>= in4 -10)  (<= in4 10)  (>= in5

in2), (in1 \u2264 in2)\n\nFor bigger N, the pattern is similarly hierarchical:\n- form pairs or small groups, order inside and order between groups,\n- cluster the groups,\n- combine constraints transitively.\n\nFor N=8:\n- groups: (in0, in1), (in2, in3), (in4, in5), (in6, in7)\n- order inside each pair\n- order between groups etc.\n\nThis matches a balanced merge-sort style ordering constraints.\n\nApproach for N=26:\n- Treat input indices [0..25].\n- Recursively split indices into halves.\n- For each half, generate constraints recursively.\n- Merge constraints between halves: enforce ordering for all elements in the left half \u2264 all elements in the right half.\n- Combine constraints by (and ....).\n\nThe final output should be in a single `(assert (and ...))` clause without nested ands to follow the instructions.\n\nImplementation notes:\n- We should generate for 26 elements the recursive constraints.\n- In each step, do:\n  - constraints_left = constraints for left half\n  - constraints_right = constraints for right half\n  - constraints_between = all constraints in the form (<= inx iny) for inx in left half, iny in right half\n- Then combine all constraints into one big (and ...)\n\nNext, let's generate these constraints step by step.\n\n---\n\nIndices = [0..25]\n\nSplit into halves:\n\nleft_half = [0..12] (13 elements)\nright_half = [13..25] (13 elements)\n\nWe'll do recursively for left_half and right_half.\n\n---\n\nLet's write a recursive function that for a given list of indices generates the ordering constraints:\n\n- If len(indices) == 1: return empty\n- Else:\n  - split into left and right halves\n  - get constraints for left\n  - get constraints for right\n  - add constraints that for every l in left, every r in right: (<= inl inr)\n  - add constraints inside each half recursively\n\nWe'll do this manually for the main splits:\n\n---\n\nRecursive step for [0..12]:\n\nlen=13, split:\n\nleft_half = [0..6]\nright_half =

For N=4 and similar N=16+ examples, usually it includes it for merges.\n\nWait, cross pairs in base units:\n\nAt lower levels, the constraints directly given are for (<= in0 in1), (<= in2 in3), and then (<= in0 in2), (<= in1 in2), \n\nThen in bigger merges, it is typical that all elements in left half are <= elements in right half.\n\nSo this means for [0..1] and [2..3]:\n\n(<= in0 in2) (<= in0 in3)\n(<= in1 in2) (<= in1 in3)\n\nSimilarly for all merges.\n\nHence for merges, for all x in left half, y in right half, (<= inx iny)\n\nWe must therefore add the complete bipartite order for all merges, not just partial.\n\nTherefore, the number of constraints is large but systematic.\n\n---\n\nLet's implement smartly:\n\nAt each merge step, generate all pairs (x,y) with x in left half, y in right half.\n\nBase case constraints:\n\n- For pairs of consecutive elements (single pairs), add (<= in_x in_y)\n\nStart from bottom and go up:\n\nFor each 2-consecutive slices:\n\n[0..1]: (<= in0 in1)\n\n[2..3]: (<= in2 in3)\n\n[4..5]: (<= in4 in5)\n\n[6..7]: (<= in6 in7)\n\n...\n\nBut since N=26, we need these pairs:\n\nconsecutive pairs:\n\n(<= in0 in1)\n(<= in2 in3)\n(<= in4 in5)\n(<= in6 in7)\n(<= in8 in9)\n(<= in10 in11)\n(<= in12 in13)\n(<= in14 in15)\n(<= in16 in17)\n(<= in18 in19)\n(<= in20 in21)\n(<= in22 in23)\n(<= in24 in25)\n\n---\n\nThen recursively, for every pair of halves (left, right), add all constraints (<= inx iny) for x in left, y in right\n\n---\n\nWe can programmatically define the left/right halves as per recursive splits:\n\nN=26 indices:\n\n[0..25]\n\nSplit ranges are:\n\n[0..12], [13..25]\n\n[0..12]:\n\n[0..6], [7..12]\n\n[0..6]:\n\n[0..3], [4..6]\n\n[0..3]:\n\n[0..1], [2..3]\n\n[0..1]: leaf pair\n\n[2..3]: leaf pair\n\n[4..6]:\n\n[4], [5..6]\n\n[5..6]: leaf pair\n\n[7..12]:\n\n[7..9], [10..12]\n\n[7..9]:\n\n[7], [8..9]\n\n[8..9]: leaf pair\n\n[10..12]:\n\n[10], [11..12]\n\n[11..12]: leaf pair\n\n[13..25]:\n\n[13..19], [20..25]\n\n[13..19]:\n\n[13..16], [17..19]\n\n[13..16]:\n\n[13..14], [15..16]\n\n[13..14]: leaf pair\n\n[15..16]: leaf pair\n\n[17..19]:\n\n[17], [18..19]\n\n[18..19]: leaf pair\n\n[20..25]:\n\n[20..22], [23..25]\n\n[20..22]:\n\n[20], [21..22]\n\n[21..22]: leaf pair\n\n[23..25]:\n\n[23], [24..25]\n\n[24..25]: leaf pair\n\n---\n\nUsing this, we can assemble all sets of pairwise order constraints (<= inx iny).\n\n---\n\nWe will output all the base pairs and all cross-group constraints.\n\n---\n\nLet's start enumerating:\n\nLeaf pairs:\n\n(<= in0 in1)\n(<= in2 in3)\n(<= in4 in5)\n(<= in6 in7)\n(<= in8 in9)\n(<= in10 in11)\n(<= in12 in13)\n(<= in14 in15)\n(<= in16 in17)\n(<= in18 in19)\n(<= in20 in21)\n(<= in22 in23)\n(<= in24 in25)\n\n---\n\nCross constraints from merge [0..1] and [2..3]:\n\nAll x in [0,1], y in [2,3]:\n\n(<= in0 in2), (<= in0 in3), (<= in1 in2), (<= in1 in3)\n\n---\n\nMerge [4] and [5..6]:\n\n(<= in4 in5), (<= in4 in6)\n\n---\n\nMerge [0..3] and [4..6]:\n\nAll x in [0..3], y in [4..6]:\n\n(<= in0 in4), (<= in0 in5), (<= in0 in6)\n\n(<= in1 in4), (<= in1 in5), (<= in1 in6)\n\n(<= in2 in4), (<= in2 in5), (<= in2 in6)\n\n(<= in3 in4), (<= in3 in5), (<= in3 in6)\n\n---\n\nMerge [7] and [8..9]:\n\n(<= in7 in8), (<= in7 in9)\n\n---\n\nMerge [10] and [11..12]:\n\n(<= in10 in11), (<= in10 in12)\n\n---\n\nMerge [7..9] and [10..12]:\n\nx in [7..9], y in [10..12]:\n\n(<= in7 in10), (<= in7 in11), (<= in7 in12)\n\n(<= in8 in10), (<= in8 in11), (<= in8 in12)\n\n(<= in9 in10), (<= in9 in11), (<= in9 in12)\n\n---\n\nMerge [0..12] and [13..25]:\n\nFor x in [0..12], y in [13..25]:\n\nThis is a big set:\n\nFor x = 0..12 and y = 13..25, 13*13 = 169 constraints:\n\n(<= in0 in13) ...

The constraints appear to be related to ordering or partial ordering over groups of variables.\n\nFor small N:\n- N=2: (assert (<= in0 in1))\n- N=3: (assert (and (<= in0 in1) (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2)))\n\nThis is basically expressing that variables are ordered: in0 \u2264 in1 \u2264 in2.\n\nFrom N=7 and beyond, the constraints form a tree-like structure of pairwise inequalities grouped in balanced combinations.\n\nLooking carefully at N=7:\n\n(assert (and \n   (and\n     (and\n       (and\n         (and\n           (and\n             (and\n               (and (and (and \n                 (<= in0 in1) (<= in2 in3)) \n                 (<= in0 in2)) (<= in1 in2)) \n                 (<= in4 in5)) (<= in4 in6)) (<= in5 in6))\n                 (<= in0 in4)) (<= in1 in4)) (<= in2 in4)) (<= in3 in4)))\n\nLet's try to interpret this structure as a merge tree or balanced grouping:\n- The variables are divided into subgroups:\n  - Group1: in0, in1, in2, in3\n  - Group2: in4, in5, in6\n  \nThey compute pairwise constraints inside these groups and then constraints linking those groups.\n\nSimilarly, at N=10 and N=11, it looks like the variables are divided recursively into smaller groups, with constraints expressing ordering in subgroups and merging them.\n\nIn particular, the pattern is consistent with a 'merge tree' or hierarchical ordering:\n\n- Recursively split the input variables into (approximately) two halves.\n- Generate constraints for each half recursively.\n- Then generate constraints linking the halves. The linking constraints are inequalities from every variable in the left half to every variable in the right half.\n\nLet's try to verify the linking constraints for N=7:\n\nFrom the example:\n\n- Left half: in0-in3\n- Right half: in4-in6\n\nThe linking constraints include:\n\n(<= in0 in4), (<= in1 in4), (<= in2 in4), (<= in3 in4)\n\nSo, every left variable \u2264 in4 (smallest of right?), and inside the right half, further constraints order them.\n\nBut I also see (<= in4 in5), (<= in4 in6), (<= in5 in6) which are constraints within right half.\n\nSo the pattern appears to represent a merge tree sorting network constraints.\n\nSimilarly for N=10 and N=11.\n\nHence, for N=17, let's apply the same logic:\n\n- Split in0..in16 into two halves:\n  Left half: in0..in8 (9 elements)\n  Right half: in9..in16 (8 elements)\n\n- Recursively generate constraints inside left half (size 9)\n- Recursively generate constraints inside right half (size 8)\n- Then generate linking constraints connecting the left half variables to some variables in the right half.\n\nBut the given examples don't show linking constraints between *all* variables in left and all variables in right.\n\nAt N=10 for example:\n- Left half: in0..in4 (5 elements)\n- Right half: in5..in9 (5 elements)\n\nThe linking constraints between halves:\n\n(<= in0 in5), (<= in1 in5), (<= in2 in5), (<= in3 in5), (<= in4 in5)\n\nSimilarly for N=11:\n\nLeft half: in0..in5 (6 elements)\n\nRight half: in6..in10 (5 elements)\n\nLinking constraints:\n\n(<= in0 in6), (<= in1 in6), ..., (<= in5 in6)\n\nHence the left half variables are linked only to the first element of the right half in these linking constraints, not all right half variables.\n\nSo, the linking constraints appear between every variable in the left half to the first variable in the right half.\n\nSimilarly, inside each half recursion applies.\n\nThus:\n\nFor N=17:\n\n- Left half: in0..in8 (9 vars)\n- Right half: in9..in16 (8 vars)\n\nWe need to generate recursively constraints for N=9 and N=8, then add linking constraints from all in0..in8 \u2264 in9.\n\nLet's build constraints for N=8 and N=9 recalling the pattern.\n\nGiven the complexity and time, let's write a helper \"merge_constraints\" description:\n\n- if N=1: no constraints\n- if N=2: constraint (<= in0 in1)\n- if N>2:\n  - split array into left and right halves (left size L, right size R)\n  - recursively generate constraints for left and right halves\n  - link: for all i in left do (<= in_i in_j) where j is first in right half (lowest index)\n\nWe see some intra-halves constraints also form a merge tree by repeated merging.\n\nLet's try to generate the SMT-LIB assertion hierarchically.\n\nSteps:\n\n1.

We can generate these by repeated wrapping:\n\ne.g. base expr = in 1\n\nFor each layer: (- expr 1)\n\nWe do that 9 times for c11, 8 times for c10, etc.\n\nNow the final expression is:\n\n(assert (and c1 (and c2 (and c3 (and c4 (and c5 (and c6 (and c7 (and c8 (and c9 (and c10 c11)))))))))))\n\nNote: the shorthand used in examples is (and (and (and ... ) ) )\n\nNo extra whitespaces or comments.\n\nI will write it exactly as per the example.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (>= in 0) (<= in 10)) (> in 1)) (> (- in 1) 1)) (> (- (- in 1) 1) 1)) (> (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1)) (> (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)) (> (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)) (> (- (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)) (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1)) (> (- (- (- (- (- (- (- (- in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))))</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1116, "completion_tokens": 1686, "total_tokens": 2802, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

Each input variable in0, in1, ..., inN-1 has bounds -10 <= in_i <= 10.\n2. The variable t has bounds -100 <= t <= 100.\n3. Several \"not equal\" constraints involving t and partial sums of the inputs:\n   - For each i from 0 to N-1:\n     - (not (= in_i t))\n   - For sums of consecutive inputs:\n     - For each i <= j < N, sums of the form:\n       ( + in_j ( + in_(j-1) ( + ... in_i ) ) )\n     This means all contiguous sub-sums starting at i and ending at j, are not equal to t.\n     However, from the examples, the sums are constructed cumulatively from the left:\n     For example, for N=5:\n       (not (= ( + in1 in0) t))\n       (not (= ( + in2 ( + in1 in0)) t))\n       ...\n   - Additionally, for each i, (not (= in_i t)) appears again near the end of the conjunction.\n\nLooking carefully:\n\n- The sets of \"not equal (sum t)\" constraints are:\n  - For each prefix sums: sums starting at 0 and ending at i (i from 1 to N-1).\n  - For each \"shifted\" prefix sums for i>0, sums starting at i and ending at j for j>=i.\n\nBut more concretely, from the examples:\n\n- For N=4: the \"not equal\" constraints appear in this order:\n  - (not (= in0 t))\n  - (not (= (+ in1 in0) t))\n  - (not (= (+ in2 (+ in1 in0)) t))\n  - (not (= (+ in3 (+ in2 (+ in1 in0))) t))\n  - (not (= in1 t))\n  - (not (= (+ in2 in1) t))\n  - (not (= (+ in3 (+ in2 in1)) t))\n  - (not (= in2 t))\n  - (not (= (+ in3 in2) t))\n  - (not (= in3 t))\n\nSo for i from 0 to 3:\n- For each i, generate all sums starting at i and ending at j (j >= i), and assert (not (= sum t))\n- For i, first the sums starting at 0 and ending at j >= 0:\n  - sums over indices from 0 to j, j in [0,N-1]\n  But for the sums starting at i>0 only sums up to N-1.\n  \nGenerating all contiguous sums from i to j for i <= j < N.\n\nSo the complete set of constraints is:\n- For i in 0..N-1:\n  - For j in i..N-1:\n    - sum = in_j + in_{j-1} + ... + in_i\n    - assert (not (= sum t))\n\nBut given the SMT-LIB format, sums are nested additions from right to left:\ne.g., (+ in3 (+ in2 (+ in1 in0))) for sum in0+in1+in2+in3.\n\nSteps to build:\n\n1. Variable bounds:\n   - For each in_i: ( >= in_i -10 )  ( <= in_i 10 )\n   - For t: ( >= t -100 )  ( <= t 100 )\n\n2. For i in 0..N-1:\n   For j in i..N-1:\n     build nested sum s_ij = in_j + ... + in_i\n     (not (= s_ij t))\n\n3. Put everything inside a top-level (assert (and ...)) clause combining all constraints.\n\nNote that the examples have a deeply nested (and), but requirement is just a single (and ...) with all constraints, no extra nesting required other than what SMT-LIB needs.\n\n4. Use exact canonical format, with spaces exactly as shown, spaces around operators and parentheses.\n\nLet's build this for N=14.\n\nIndexes: 0..13\n\nNumber of input bounds: 14 * 2 = 28\nNumber of t bounds: 2\nNumber of not eqaul constraints: Number of contiguous subarrays = N*(N+1)/2 = 14*15/2=105\n\nTotal constraints: 28 + 2 +105 = 135 entries inside the big and.\n\nWe'll generate all constraints in order: \n- all input bounds from in0 to in13\n- bounds for t\n- all (not (= sum t)) constraints for all i,j: i=0..13, j=i..13\n\nWe should keep order similar as example:\n- first input bounds in index order,\n- then t bounds,\n- then not equals for sums starting from i=0..13 with increasing j,\n- the example also shows ordering as all sums starting from i=0, then i=1, etc.\n\nAlso note: each sum is nested addition from the right, e.g.\n\nsum(in0, in1, in2) = (+ in2 (+ in1 in0))\n\nor (+ in_j (+ in_{j-1} ... in_i))\n\nImplementation plan:\n- Write a function to build nested sums,\n- Enumerate all constraints,\n- Join them all inside a single (assert (and ...)) clause.\n\nLet's proceed.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and  (>= in0 -10)  (<= in0 10)  (>= in1 -10)  (<= in1

For group1 (in0..in9): split into in0..in4 and in5..in9 (both 5 elements), use N=5 pattern on each\n\n2. Merge in0..in4 and in5..in9 with cross constraints from in0..in4 to in5..in9 (similar to N=10 example)\n\n3. For group2 (in10..in19): similarly split into in10..in14 and in15..in19, apply same\n\n4. Merge in10..in14 and in15..in19\n\n5. Finally, merge group1 and group2 by constraints (<= in0..in9 in10) (all of in0..in9 <= in10), (<= in1 in10), etc.\n\n---\n\nBecause just giving the final constraints as nested and is complicated, notice the earlier ids of nested and.\n\nAt the topmost level, the nesting of (and ....) repeated is one less than total constraints' and nesting.\n\nSo most constraints appear as a chain of nested and:\n\n`(assert (and (and (and ... (<= ...) (<= ...)) ...) ...) ...)`\n\n---\n\n### Summary of inequalities needed in SMT-LIB form:\n\n1. Sort in0..in4 among themselves (N=5 from example):\n- (<= in0 in1), (<= in0 in2), (<= in1 in2), (<= in3 in4), (<= in0 in3), (<= in1 in3), (<= in2 in3)\n\n2.

Merge in0..in4 and in5..in9:\n- (<= in0 in5), (<= in1 in5), (<= in2 in5), (<= in3 in5), (<= in4 in5)\n\n---\n\nSimilarly, group2: in10..in14 and in15..in19\n\n- Sort in10..in14 (like N=5 example)\n- Sort in15..in19 (like N=5)\n- Merge in10..in14 with in15..in19\n\nThen final merge:\n\n- (<= in0 in10), (<= in1 in10), ..., (<= in9 in10)\n\n---\n\nThis should be the pattern, constructing recursively.\n\n---\n\n### Now, write constraints from bottom up:\n\n- First define helper constraints for subgroups with 5 elements:\n\nN=5 constraints (from example):\n\n```smt\n(and (and (and (and (and (and\n  (<= inX inY)\n  (<= inX inZ))\n  (<= inY inZ))\n  (<= inW inV))\n  (<= inX inW))\n  (<= inY inW))\n  (<= inZ inW))\n```\n\nwith inputs indexed appropriately.\n\nFor in0..in4:\n\n- So substitute:\n\n(<= in0 in1)\n(<= in0 in2)\n(<= in1 in2)\n(<= in3 in4)\n(<= in0 in3)\n(<= in1 in3)\n(<= in2 in3)\n\nSimilarly for in5..in9:\n\nAdd 5 to each index:\n\n(<= in5 in6)\n(<= in5 in7)\n(<= in6 in7)\n(<= in8 in9)\n(<= in5 in8)\n(<= in6 in8)\n(<= in7 in8)\n\nThen merge:\n\n(<= in0 in5)\n(<= in1 in5)\n(<= in2 in5)\n(<= in3 in5)\n(<= in4 in5)\n\nTogether, these form the constraints for in0..in9 as a whole.\n\n---\n\nSimilarly for in10..in19:\n\nSplit in10..in14:\n\n(<= in10 in11)\n(<= in10 in12)\n(<= in11 in12)\n(<= in13 in14)\n(<= in10 in13)\n(<= in11 in13)\n(<= in12 in13)\n\nin15..in19:\n\n(<= in15 in16)\n(<= in15 in17)\n(<= in16 in17)\n(<= in18 in19)\n(<= in15 in18)\n(<= in16 in18)\n(<= in17 in18)\n\nMerge constraints:\n\n(<= in10 in15)\n(<= in11 in15)\n(<= in12 in15)\n(<= in13 in15)\n(<= in14 in15)\n\n---\n\nFinal merge between groups:\n\n(<= in0 in10)\n(<= in1 in10)\n(<= in2 in10)\n(<= in3 in10)\n(<= in4 in10)\n(<= in5 in10)\n(<= in6 in10)\n(<= in7 in10)\n(<= in8 in10)\n(<= in9 in10)\n\n---\n\n### Nest the and clauses:\n\n- For every 7 constraints inside an (and ...) nested\n- Then merge the two halves with the 5 constraints are inside nested (and ...)\n\n- Same for the full merge.\n\n---\n\nGiven the large number of constraints (7 per 5-element group) * 4 subgroups + merges (5 constraints per merge) + final merge (10 constraints) total constraints to connect 20 variables:\n\nNumber total constraints:\n\nEach 5-element group: 7 constraints\n\n4 such groups => 28 constraints\n\nEach merge between two 5-element groups: 5 constraints - 2 merges => 10 constraints\n\nFinal merge: 10 constraints\n\nTotal: 28 + 10 + 10 = 48 constraints linked by nested and.\n\n---\n\n### Build the nested and:\n\nOrder constraints as in example, flatten and combine into nested `(and ... )` as done in examples.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer outline:\n\n(assert (and \n  ; in0..in4 constraints (7)\n  (<= in0 in1)\n  (<= in0 in2)\n  (<= in1 in2)\n  (<= in3 in4)\n  (<= in0 in3)\n  (<= in1 in3)\n  (<= in2 in3)\n  \n  ; in5..in9 constraints (7)\n  (<= in5 in6)\n  (<= in5 in7)\n  (<= in6 in7)\n  (<= in8 in9)\n  (<= in5 in8)\n  (<= in6 in8)\n  (<= in7 in8)\n\n  ; merge group in0..in4 and in5..in9 (5)\n  (<= in0 in5)\n  (<= in1 in5)\n  (<= in2 in5)\n  (<= in3 in5)\n  (<= in4 in5)\n  \n  ; in10..in14 (7)\n  (<= in10 in11)\n  (<= in10 in12)\n  (<= in11 in12)\n  (<= in13 in14)\n  (<= in10 in13)\n  (<= in11 in13)\n  (<= in12 in13)\n  \n  ; in15..in19 (7)\n  (<= in15 in16)\n  (<= in15 in17)\n  (<= in16 in17)\n  (<= in18 in19)\n  (<= in15 in18)\n  (<= in16 in18)\n  (<= in17 in18)\n  \n  ; merge group in10..in14 and in15..in19 (5)\n  (<= in10 in15)\n  (<= in11 in15)\n  (<= in12 in15)\n  (<= in13 in15)\n  (<= in14 in15)\n\n  ; final merge between group in0..in9 and in10..in19 (10)\n  (<= in0 in10)\n  (<= in1 in10)\n  (<= in2 in10)\n  (<= in3 in10)\n  (<= in4 in10)\n  (<= in5 in10)\n  (<= in6 in10)\n  (<= in7 in10)\n  (<= in8 in10)\n  (<= in9 in10)\n))\n\n---\n\n### Nest the `and` clauses as in the examples:\n\nExamples show a fully nested and for each constraint like:\n\n(and (and (and ...

every pair (i, j) with i < j, the constraint in_i \u2264 in_j is asserted.\n\nThe constraints are nested \"and\" statements pairing variables from smaller index to higher index variables in a decreasing sequence, i.e., starting from the highest index variable:\n\n- For N=2: just ( <= in0 in1 )\n- For N=4: all pairs where i < j from the set {0, 1, 2, 3}, generating the inequalities:\n    (

examples, in a right-associative nested manner, but for simplicity, I can produce a flat version: (assert (and ...all inequalities...))\n\nThe example preserves nested (and (and (...)) ) structure, due to how SMT-LIB parses multiple arguments in (and ...)\n\nBut the example shows very heavy nesting left-associative, but the task only says the formula must be exact and canonical and all constraints combined in a top-level (assert (and ...)) clause.\n\nSo, I'll produce the single-assertion with a single (and ...) containing all inequalities.\n\nAlso, the SMT-LIB format requires

For variables in0 to inN-1, each has bounds: (>= inX -10) and (<= inX 10).\n\n2. The variable t has the bounds: (>= t -100) and (<= t 100).\n\n3. The \"not equal\" constraints include two groups:\n\n   - For every prefix sum of inputs starting at in0, negated equality with t:\n     \n     For each start index i = 0 to N-1:\n       For each end index j from i to N-1:\n         (not (= ( + inj ... in i) t))\n         \n     However, notice from the examples that sums are constructed from left to right in nested additions:\n     For i=0:\n         not (= in0 t)\n         not (= (+ in1 in0) t)\n         not (= (+ in2 (+ in1 in0)) t)\n         ...\n     For i=1:\n         not (= in1 t)\n         not (= (+ in2 in1) t)\n         not (= (+ in3 (+ in2 in1)) t)\n         ...\n     and so on.\n\n   More specifically, for each i = 0 to N-1:\n     For j = i to N-1:\n       sum in_j + ... + in_i, note the order is inside-out for nesting parentheses.\n       (not (= sum t))\n\n   So total number of such constraints: sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (N - i) = N(N+1)/2\n\nLet's confirm with N=6:\n\nNumber of not equal constraints to t is: 6*7/2 = 21  \nCounting in the example matches 21 \"not (= ... t)\" constraints.\n\n4. The SMT-LIB syntax uses a very nested \"and\" for all assertions combined.\n\nOur task is to output exactly in the canonical SMT-LIB form with \"assert (and ...)\" top-level clause that ands together:\n\n- For each in_i: (>= in_i -10), (<= in_i 10)\n- For t: (>= t -100), (<= t 100)\n- For all \"not equal\" constraints between sums from i to j and t.\n\n5. Constructing the sum expressions for ( + ... ), nested from the innermost addition upward. For example:\n   For i=0, j=0: in0\n   For i=0, j=1: (+ in1 in0)\n   For i=0, j=2: (+ in2 (+ in1 in0))\n   For i=0, j=3: (+ in3 (+ in2 (+ in1 in0 )))\n   ...\n   For i=k, j=k: ink\n   For i=k, j=k+1: (+ in(k+1) ink)\n   and so forth.\n\n6. So for N=12:\n   Inputs: in0 ... in11\n   Each has bounds: >= -10 and <= 10\n   t bounds: >= -100, <= 100\n   Number of \"not equal\" constraints is 12*13/2 = 78\n\n7. We'll build in order:\n   - All in_i >= -10 and <= 10\n   - t >= -100 and <= 100\n   - then the not equal constraints for all prefix sums.\n\n8. Avoid extra comments or whitespace (only space separating tokens).\n   The nested and's can be very long, but we follow the same pattern:\n   (assert (and (and ... all parts ...)))\n\nNote: The nested (and (and ...)) structure is very deep. But since the input demands exact canonical SMT-LIB format, we'll replicate the same nested structure as in the example (where each two arguments of and are combined through nested \"and\"s).\n\nTo keep syntactic consistency, for 12 variables and all constraints, we need a perfectly nested \"and\" for all clauses.\n\nLength calculation:\n\nNumber of clauses:\n\n- For each in_i: 2 bounds \u2192 24 clauses\n- For t: 2 clauses \u2192 2 clauses\n- Number of \"not equal\" constraints: 78 clauses\n\nTotal clauses: 24 + 2 + 78 = 104 clauses combined with \"and\" nested.\n\nWe'll nest ands (combining two clauses at a time from left to right), forming a deep nested \"and\".\n\nTo do it (like in the examples):\n\n- Start with clause1, clause2, combine with (and clause1 clause2)\n- Then combine that with clause3: (and (and clause1 clause2) clause3)\n- Then combine that with clause4: (and (and (and clause1 clause2) clause3) clause4)\n- ...\n\nSo depth is equal to number of clauses minus 1 = 103 nested ands.\n\nConstructing the clauses list:\n\nclauses = []\n\n1) in0 bounds: (>= in0 -10), (<= in0 10)\n2) in1 bounds: ...\n...\n3) in11 bounds: (>= in11 -10), (<= in11 10)\n4) t bounds: (>= t -100), (<= t 100)\n\n5) not equal constraints:\n\nFor i = 0 to 11:\n   for j = i to 11:\n      build sum_expr = in_j + ... + in_i nested\n      add (not (= sum_expr t)) clause\n\nLet's generate the sum_expr:\n\nFor example for i=3, j=5:\n( + in5 ( + in4 in3 ) )\n\nWe can implement this with a small helper to generate these nested sums.\n\nFinally, nest and clauses as per the given pattern.\n\nWe will produce the SMT-LIB string accordingly.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and

They use nested `(and (and ... ) ... )` until all pairs are combined.\n\nWe note that for N=k, the number of pairs is k*(k-1)/2, and the nesting is left-heavy: the top-level `(assert (and ...))` contains an `(and (and (and ...` nested k*(k-1)/2 -1 times and then the last comparison.\n\nSo for N=21, we need to produce:\n\n`(assert (and (and (and ... (and ( > in0 in1) ( > in0 in2)) ( > in0 in3)) ... ) ... ))`\n\nwith all pairs `(i, j)` where i < j in lexicographic order (by i first, then j).\n\nNumber of pairs = 21*20/2 = 210 pairs.\n\nWe will write the full expression with nested `(and (and ... ) ... )` wrapping 210 pairs.\n\nThe pattern: start wrapping with `(and (and ... first_pair) second_pair)`, then keep nesting.\n\nThis can be generated programmatically, but for exact formatting, we have to follow the canonical format:\n\n- Each comparison: `( > in{i} in{j})` with spaces as `( >  in{i} in{j})`\n- Nested `(and (and ... ) ... )` wrapping each pair one by one.\n\nExample for N=3:\n```\n(assert (and\n  (and\n    ( >  in0 in1)\n    ( >  in0 in2)\n  )\n  ( >  in1 in2)\n))\n```\n\nFor N=21, the final will be a single string with nested `(and`s and comparisons.\n\nSolution outline:\n\n1. Generate pairwise constraints `( >  in{i} in{j})` for 0 \u2264 i < j < 21\n2. Combine by nesting from left to right as `(and left right)`\n\nBecause the output examples used each nested pairwise `(and (and ... ) ... )` without newlines, we will produce similarly, but all in one string.\n\nWe must avoid extra commentary.\n\nSummary: produce a single `(assert (and (... nested 'and's ... )))` with each pair `( >  in{i} in{j})`.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and

Normally `(> a b)` implies `(>= a b)` but here both are included.\n\nBUT the examples show the constraints exactly like that. For each pair (i,j), with i<j:\n\n- `(>= in_i in_j)` followed by `(> in_i in_j)`.\n\nThis is unusual: `(>= in_i in_j)` and `(> in_i in_j)` cannot both be true unless the variables are overlapping or the constraints are inconsistent, but since both present in examples we must replicate exactly.\n\nAfter the pairwise constraints, for each variable `in_k`, add `(not (= in_k in))` and `(>= in_k in)`.\n\nThe constraint is finally wrapped in `(assert (and ...))`.\n\nThe structure is canonical SMT-LIB: all constraints combined under one `(and ...)` at top-level.\n\nFor N=20:\n\n- Variables: `in0` to `in19`.\n- For all pairs `(i,j)`, `0 <= i < j < 20`:\n  - `(>= in_i in_j)`\n  - `(> in_i in_j)`\n- For all k in `[0..19]`:\n  - `(not (= in_k in))`\n  - `(>= in_k in)`\n\nCanonical SMT-LIB uses spacing consistent with the examples:\n\n`( >=  in0 in1)`, `( >  in0 in1)`, etc.\n\nHence, the format is:\n\n(assert (and \n\n  ... all pairs constraints ...\n\n  ... all single variable constraints ...\n\n))\n\nDue to the large number of pairs (~190 pairs, each with two constraints = 380 conjuncts, and 20 * 2 = 40 constraints for single variables), the final SMT-LIB constraint will be very long.\n\nWe must write this in a flat structure with nested `(and ...)` such that the top-level is `(assert (and ...))`. Inside, we nest `(and ...)` pairs until all constraints are combined.\n\nFrom examples, the pattern is:\n\n- For pairwise constraints, they nest all the `(and ...)` so that the entire pairwise block is one big nested `(and ...)` with all pairwise constraints.\n- Then the single-variable constraints are added at the same top-level `and` (flattened).\n\nSo the final is:\n\n(assert (and \n\n  (and ...nested and for all pairwise constraints...)\n\n  (not (= in0 in)) (>= in0 in)\n\n  (not (= in1 in)) (>= in1 in)\n\n  ...\n\n  (not (= in19 in)) (>= in19 in)\n\n))\n\nWe must create the nested `(and ... )` for pairs.\n\nThe nesting style from examples is:\n\n- For each new conjunct, it nests by one more `(and ...)` on the left-hand side, i.e.:\n\n(and (and (and c1 c2) c3) c4) ... and so forth.\n\nHence the pairs constraints will form a left-branching chain of nested `(and ...)`\n\nTo generate the full constraint:\n\n1. For all pairs `(i,j)` where i<j:\n\n   Add `(>= in_i in_j)`, then `(> in_i in_j)`, each as separate conjuncts.\n\n2. Nest all these pairwise constraints into a big nested left-branching `(and ... (and (and ...)))`.\n\n3. At the top-level, `(and` opens again and includes the pairs nested block and on the right side all the single-variable constraints as separate conjuncts.\n\n4. No extra commentary or line breaks other than consistent spacing.\n\n5. Variable names exactly `in0` ... `in19` and constant `in` as in examples.\n\nBecause the constraint is large, let's produce the final SMT-LIB assertion with all constraints exactly as

The first two constraints are always:\n   - (>= in 0)\n   - (<= in 10)\n\n2. Then there are multiple nested (and ... (>) ...) clauses involving the term ( - in 1) repeated multiple times.\n\n3. The nested \"greater than\" constraints are:\n   ( >  in 1)\n   ( >  ( -  in 1) 1)\n   ( >  ( -  ( -  in 1) 1) 1)\n   ( >  ( -  ( -  ( -  in 1) 1) 1) 1)\n   ...\n   \n   Each extra nesting adds one more ( - ...) around \"in 1\".\n\n4. Counting for N=5, the constraints look like:\n\n   - The base two (>= in 0), (<= in 10)\n   - Then a chain of (>) constraints where the number of nested ( - ...) around \"in 1\" is equal to (N - 1).\n\n5. For example:\n   \n   N=5 has 10 nested (and ... ) with 10 conditions including the two boundary checks.\n   But looking carefully: N=5 example has a total of 10 \"items\" inside the top-level 'and', corresponding to i from 0 to 9.\n\n   Actually in N=5:\n\n   (assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and\n\n   So ten conjuncts in total.\n\n   The first two conjuncts are:\n\n   ( >=  in 0)\n   ( <=  in 10)\n\n   Then 8 more \">\" constraints, each nested deeper.\n\n   Similarly for N=7, there are 10 top level conjuncts (the same as N=5)\n\n   So from the given examples, the exact number of conjuncts does not seem related directly to N.\n\n   But the input \"in\" is a function of an index. The only variable referred in inequalities is \"in 1\".\n\n6. Hypothesis:\n\n   The \"in\" might be an array or something, or \"in i\" means the variable \"in\" at index i, but here always \"in 1\" is used inside the > constraints, and (in 0) is used in the boundaries.\n\n7. It looks like the \"in 1\" is distinguished, and the nested sequences are deeper as N increases.\n\n8. Looking at the ( >  ( -  ( -  ( ...  in 1) 1) 1) 1)\n\n   For example, N=5: the last nested one is ( - ... repeated 9 times in total?), matching the number of conjuncts.\n\n   At N=5, we have 10 conjuncts total:\n\n   - ( >=  in 0)\n   - ( <=  in 10)\n   - then 8 more (>) constraints with nesting from 0 to 7\n\n9. So the number of (>) constraints is 8 for N=5, 10 for N=7, so it doesn't seem to map directly.\n\n10. Checking carefully with N=5:\n\n      The nested > constraints count is (N-2) + 1 ? Or does it relate to N at all?\n\n11. Checking 'N=11' given:\n\n     The outermost (assert (and (and (and ... 10 times (and (and ... ) ... )))) structure.\n\n     Always 10 (and ... ) at the outermost level, no matter N.\n\n12. The first two are always (>= (in 0)) and (<= (in 10))\n\n13. The rest are always \">\" constraints on nested subtractions of \"in 1\", accumulative.\n\n14. The last example is for N=15: still 10 outermost conjuncts, matching the pattern.\n\n15. So this is confusing since N changes but the number of conjuncts in \"and\" does not.\n\n16. But the main observation is: for all Ns, the exact constraints string is identical - only difference might be the nesting level in the ( > ...) constraints in the rest conjuncts.\n\nWait, actually all the examples for different Ns are identical in the text! They all show the same expression repeated multiple times with 10 top-level conjuncts.\n\nThis suggests something is missing or the examples are showing the same snippet for different N that does not depend on N.\n\nHence, maybe the constraint is always the same, and not really depending on N.\n\nGiven the question \"What is the constraint for N=21?\" and the prior examples, and that the constraints repeat for all Ns and are the same for different N, the best assumption is the constraint is the same regardless of N.\n\nSo the answer is exactly like the example provided for any N:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  \n    ( >=  in 0)  \n    ( <=  in 10))  \n    ( >  in 1))  \n    ( >  ( -  in 1) 1))  \n    ( >  ( -  ( -  in 1) 1) 1))  \n    ( >  ( -  ( -  ( -  in 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n    ( >  ( -  ( -  ( -  ( -  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n    ( >  ( -  ( -  ( -  ( -  ( -  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n    ( >  ( -  ( -  ( -  ( -  ( -  ( -  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n    ( >  ( -  ( -  ( -  ( -  ( -  ( -  ( -  in 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 1))  \n))\n\nClosing all the parentheses.\n\nSo, the answer for N=21 is the same pattern with 10 nested (and ... ) conjuncts.

The constraints appear to be encoding a sorted structure by grouping elements progressively and then asserting ordering relations between groups, combined with \"and\" clauses. The structure seems hierarchical:\n\n- Group the inputs into smaller sorted groups.\n- Assert relations among these groups.\n\nFrom the examples:\n\n- N=4: 4 elements, grouping pairs and then combining to order the entire set.\n\n- N=8: There are groups (in0,in1), (in2,in3), (in4,in5), (in6,in7), then orderings between these groups.\n\n- N=9 groups the first 3 elements, then groups of 2, then orders between these groups.\n\n- N=12, N=13, N=18 all show recursive grouping and ordering but also their own group connections.\n\nObserving carefully the last big one N=18:\n\n- Elements grouped into sorted triples or pairs.\n\n- Then relations asserted between group leaders.\n\n- Finally relations between groups recursively merged up to the full vector.\n\nFor N=24, likely the next hierarchical grouping is:\n\n- Three groups of 8 elements each (since 24 = 3 * 8).\n\n- Each group of 8 elements can be considered sorted similarly to the N=8 constraints.\n\n- Then relations between these groups.\n\nFor each level, they assert ordering between elements within groups, then between groups.\n\nIn the N=8 example, the root has three subgroups of 2 elements each at bottom level, each is sorted, then there are orderings combining these subgroups.\n\nFor N=24, we can consider the three major groups as:\n\n- Group A: in0..in7 (8 elements)\n\n- Group B: in8..in15 (8 elements)\n\n- Group C: in16..in23 (8 elements)\n\nWithin each group, the sort constraints as for N=8 apply.\n\nBetween groups:\n\n- Assert in0 <= in8 <= in16 (the minimal elements of the groups not explicitly shown in previous examples but implied by \" ( <= in0 in8), ( <= in8 in16)\" and similar assertions for other group elements.\n\n- Also assert for each element in group A, it is less or equal to each in group B, and similarly group B <= group C.\n\nThis is similar to when N=18, the top-level group is three groups of 6 elements, and all relations between lower groups and upper groups are written.\n\nThus, to write explicitly, we do:\n\n1) For each group (in0..in7, in8..in15, in16..in23), write the N=8 constraints.\n\n2) Then add constraints for ordering first element of groups (or all elements corresponding) between groups to ensure order: that all elements in group A <= all in group B, and all in group B <= all in group C.\n\nThe N=8 constraints are:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and \n  (and\n   ( <= in0 in1) ( <= in2 in3)) ( <= in0 in2)) ( <= in1 in2)\n  ( <= in4 in5) ( <= in6 in7)) ( <= in4 in6)) ( <= in5 in6))\n  ( <= in0 in4)) ( <= in1 in4)) ( <= in2 in4)) ( <= in3 in4))\n\nFor each of the three groups, repeated with offset indices.\n\nThen add cross-group constraints:\n\n- All elements in group A <= all elements in group B\n\n- All elements in group B <= all elements in group C\n\nFor example, (<= in0 in8), (<= in1 in8), ..., (<= in7 in8), then (<= in0 in9), ... (<= in7 in15), and similarly for the next group.\n\nObserving N=18 example, it asserts:\n\n(<=  in0 in9), (<= in1 in9), ..., (<= in8 in9)\n\nAnd all these inequalities accumulate.\n\nHence for N=24, the same applies with group indices adjusted.\n\nThe final SMT-LIB constraint must be in exact canonical format with only one top-level assert (and ...)\n\nThe approximate number of constraints is big, but manageable.\n\nWe proceed stepwise:\n\nGroup0 (in0..in7) \u2014 N=8 constraints with indices in0..in7\n\nGroup1 (in8..in15) \u2014 same N=8 constraints with indices +8\n\nGroup2 (in16..in23) \u2014 same N=8 constraints with indices +16\n\nCross constraints:\n\nAll elements in group0 <= all elements in group1 minimal element (e.g. in8)  \n\nSimilarly, group1 elements <= group2 minimal element (in16)\n\nAlso all elements in group0 <= group1 elements (per general pattern observed in N=18 example).\n\nWait, actually from the N=18 example, for the cross-group:\n\nGroup0: in0..in8\n\nGroup1: in9..in14   (6 elements)\n\nGroup2: in14..in17  (4 elements)\n\nLook at the last assertions:\n\n(<= in0 in9), (<= in1 in9), ..., (<= in8 in9)\n\nSimilarly for next group.\n\nSo, for simplicity:\n\nFor cross groups, all elements in group A <= the smallest element (in8) of group B\n\nAnd similarly group B <= smallest element (in16) of group C\n\nBut in N=18's example, it asserts more:\n\nIt actually asserts (<= in0 in9), (<= in1 in9), etc and also (<= in0 in14), (<= in1 in14), etc\n\nBut the pattern suggests only minimal element of next group used on the rhs of inequalities\n\nAlso the pattern from 12 and 13 suggests similar behavior.\n\nTherefore cross constraints are:\n\nFor i from 0 to 7: (<= in_i in8)\n\nFor i from 8 to 15: (<= in_i in16)\n\nAlso, for the nested structure, the example in N=8 shows that inside groups elements go in multiple asserts.\n\nThus let's write the constraints precisely.\n\nStep 1: N=8 constraints for group0 (in0..in7):\n\n   (and\n      (and\n         (and (and (and \n            (<= in0 in1) (<= in2 in3)) \n            (<= in0 in2)) \n            (<= in1 in2))\n         (<= in4 in5)) (<= in6 in7)) \n      (<= in4 in6)) (<= in5 in6))\n   (<= in0 in4)) (<= in1 in4)) (<= in2 in4)) (<= in3 in4))\n\nNote the nested accumulative ands as in the N=8 example.\n\nSimilar for group1: indices shifted by 8:\n\n(<= in8 in9), (<= in10 in11), (<= in8 in10), (<= in9 in10), (<= in12 in13), (<= in14 in15), (<= in12 in14), (<= in13 in14), (<= in8 in12), (<= in9 in12), (<= in10 in12), (<= in11 in12)\n\nSimilarly for group2: indices +16:\n\n(<= in16 in17), (<= in18 in19), (<= in16 in18), (<= in17 in18), (<= in20 in21), (<= in22 in23), (<= in20 in22), (<= in21 in22), (<= in16 in20), (<= in17 in20), (<= in18 in20), (<= in19 in20)\n\nStep 2: Add cross-group inequalities:\n\nFor i in 0..7: (<= in_i in8)\n\nFor i in 8..15: (<= in_i in16)\n\nNote: in N=18, cross-group ordering is asserted similarly.\n\nPutting all constraints under a single top-level (assert (and ...))\n\nNested ands traditionally used to keep the canonical form.\n\nTherefore, final answer is one (assert (and ...)) with deeply nested (and)s containing all those inequalities.\n\nThis is large but straightforward.\n\nUse the exact nesting style of the N=8 example repeated 3 times, then add cross elements.\n\nLet's write out the full

Variables are in0..in14, and the variable \"in\".\n\nConstraints:\n- For i in [1..14]:\n    For j in [0..i-1]:\n        (> in{i} in{j})\n\n- Then for i in [0..14]:\n    (> in in{i})\n\nThe big assertion will be a nested series of (and ... ) wrapping all these pairwise comparisons, and top-level (assert (and ... ))\n\nNo extra commentary or new variables, formatting exactly as in examples.\n\nAlso note that in SMT-LIB, the spacing: ( >  in1 in0), there are two spaces after '(' and before '>' operator, so follow the same.\n\nSo, the plan is to generate for N=15:\n\n- For i=1 to 14:\n    For j=0 to i-1:\n        ( >  in{i} in{j})\n\n- For i=0 to 14:\n    ( >  in in{i})\n\nThen, combine all clauses into a single top-level and.\n\nFrom the examples, the nested ands are fully nested as all pairwise ands, but since it's syntactically equivalent, they combined to one big and. The examples combine all constraints under one top-level (assert (and ... )) clause where the contents of (and ...) is many nested ands with two sub-expressions each. But for clarity and minimalism, if permitted, just one top-level and containing all expressions is accepted in canonical form.\n\nBut the example uses many nested (and ...) without simplifying.\n\nTherefore, follow the standard fully nested approach:\n\n- For constraints c1, c2, c3,... cM,\n  nested as (and (and ...(and c1 c2) c3) c4)... etc.\n\nCounting total constraints:\n\nNumber of constraints (pairs):\n\nSum_{i=1}^{14} i = 14*15/2 = 105\n\nPlus 15 constraints for ( > in in{i}) -> total 120 constraints.\n\nSo, 120 leaves combined as nested ands.\n\nFor nesting, the pattern is:\n\n(and c1 c2), then nest in further (and previous_result c3), etc.\n\nEffectively a left-associative folding of and over all constraints.\n\nWe can generate that as nested.\n\nWe have to produce exactly the same style as in given examples, including spacing.\n\nFor instance, start with: (assert (and (and (and (...  ( > in1 in0) ( > in2 in0) ) ( > in2 in1)) ... ))\n\nWe'll produce that nesting for all constraints.\n\nAdditional spacing: from examples, each clause has format: ( >  inX inY) with two spaces after '(' and before '>' and one space between '>' and variable names.\n\nWe'll follow that exactly.\n\nAlso note the variable names: \"in\" plus optional index. The variable \"in\" (without number) always goes last in the constraints, with ( > in in0), etc.\n\nSo the final output is a very long nested expression starting with (assert (and (...))).\n\nIt's OK to produce it programmatically.\n\nSummary:\n- Gather constraints in order: first all pairs (in{i} > in{j}) for i in 1..14, j in 0..i-1\n- Then constraints (in > in{i}) for i in 0..14\n- Then combine

( >=  in0 in1) ( >  in0 in1) ...) ... (not ( = in0 in)) ( >=  in0 in) ... ))\n\nIn each inner expression the operator is separated by a space from the next token (two spaces after the operator?).

So it's \"( >=  in0 in1)\".\n\nSame for (not ( = in0 in)) with correct spacing is \"(not ( = in0 in)))\".\n\nI'll follow exactly.\n\nTo optimize, I won't output the entire nesting manually (too large for this chat), but the instructions require the exact syntax and fully nested.\n\nSo I have to produce full output.\n\nApproach:\n\n- Create a flat list of all atomic constraints strings in order.\n\n- Then fold them into nested (and) from left to right:\n\n   expr1 = first constraint\n\n   expr2 = (and expr1 second_constraint)\n\n   expr3 = (and expr2 third_constraint)\n\n   ...\n\n- Then, wrap with (assert {exprN})\n\n- Output the final string.\n\nBecause the nesting grows large, the format is like:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and ... constraint1) constraint2) constraint3) ...) ... constraintN))\n\nI'll proceed to generate the entire string.\n\nNote: in the examples, the nested (and) expressions are like (and (and ... constraint1) constraint2), i.e., the new constraints go at the rightmost position.\n\nTherefore, start with expr = constraint1, then for each new constraint c:\n\nexpr = (and expr c)\n\nFinally, (assert expr)\n\nConstraints details:\n\n- Pairwise constraints for i=0..17, j=i+1..18:\n\n  For each pair:\n\n    ( >=  ini inj)\n\n    ( >  ini inj)\n\n- Then for each i=0..18:\n\n   (not ( = ini in))\n\n   ( >=  ini in)\n\nLet's index the variables as \"in0\", ..., \"in18\".\n\nExample of one atomic constraint: \"( >=  in0 in1)\"\n\nNow, confirm final spaces:\n\n- Open paren \"(\"\n\n- space\n\n- operator - one token e.g., >=\n\n- two spaces\n\n- first operand\n\n- space\n\n- second operand\n\n- closing paren \")\"\n\nSimilarly for (not ( = in0 in)):\n\n- \"(not ( = inX in))\"\n\nWhich is: open paren + \"not\" + space + \"( = inX

Each constraint expresses some ordering (<=) relationships between in0, in1, ..., in(N-1).\n\nFor N=2..6, the constraints are given as nested (and ...) expressions. We want an SMT-LIB style constraint for N=13.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n- The form is always: `(assert (and ...))` top-level, no nested assert.\n- Inside the `and`, multiple `(<= ...)` conditions involving input variables.\n  \nLooking at N=2..6:\n\n- N=2:\n  ```\n  (assert  ( <=  in0 in1))\n  ```\n- N=3:\n  ```\n  (assert (and (and  ( <=  in0 in1)  ( <=  in0 in2))  ( <=  in1 in2)))\n  ```\n- N=4:\n  ```\n  (assert (and (and (and  ( <=  in0 in1)  ( <=  in2 in3))  ( <=  in0 in2))  ( <=  in1 in2)))\n  ```\n- N=5:\n  ```\n  (assert (and (and (and (and (and (and  ( <=  in0 in1)  ( <=  in0 in2))  ( <=  in1 in2))  ( <=  in3 in4))  ( <=  in0 in3))  ( <=  in1 in3))  ( <=  in2 in3)))\n  ```\n- N=6:\n  ```\n  (assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  ( <=  in0 in1)  ( <=  in0 in2))  ( <=  in1 in2))  ( <=  in3 in4))  ( <=  in3 in5))  ( <=  in4 in5))  ( <=  in0 in3))  ( <=  in1 in3))  ( <=  in2 in3)))\n  ```\n\nFirst, the formulas involve grouping indices and comparing pairs from lower indices with higher indices.\n\nIt looks like the inputs are partitioned into two halves recursively and constraints enforce a merge-like ordering between these halves:\n\nFor example,\n- For N=4:\n  - `(<= in0 in1)`\n  - `(<= in2 in3)`\n  - `(<= in0 in2)`\n  - `(<= in1 in2)`\n\nThis is akin to the merge step in merge sort comparing elements in the left and right halves.\n\n- For N=5:\n  - `(<= in0 in1)`\n  - `(<= in0 in2)`\n  - `(<= in1 in2)`\n  - `(<= in3 in4)`\n  - `(<= in0 in3)`\n  - `(<= in1 in3)`\n  - `(<= in2 in3)`\n\nThis shows two groups:\n  - Left group: in0, in1, in2 (with order constraints internally)\n  - Right group: in3, in4 (with order constraints)\n  - Merging constraints: left elements <= in3\n\n- For N=6:\n  - Left group: in0, in1, in2 (with constraints)\n  - Right group: in3, in4, in5 (with constraints)\n  - Merge constraints between left and right\n\nSo it appears the constraints represent a \"merge\" ordering for a \"merge-sort\" style sorted list of inputs.\n\n**Recursion:**\n\nWe can define a function that, given indices l to r, generates the constraints as:\n\n- If l==r: no constraints\n- If r-l+1 == 2: output `(<= in_l in_r)`\n- Else:\n  - Mid = (l + r) // 2\n  - Constraints from left half (l, mid)\n  - Constraints from right half (mid+1, r)\n  - Constraints merging: For all i in [l..mid], j=mid+1, enforce `(<= in_i in_j)`\n\nNote that the given examples show merging the entire left side to specific elements of the right side (often just the first element or multiple elements).\n\nHowever, looking at N=4:\n\n```\n(assert (and (and (and  ( <=  in0 in1)  ( <=  in2 in3))  ( <=  in0 in2))  ( <=  in1 in2)))\n```\n\nWe see the merge constraints are:\n\n- `(<= in0 in2)`\n- `(<= in1 in2)`\n\nNot `(<= in0 in3)` or `(<= in1 in3)`\n\nSo for merging, the order goes like this:\n\n- For merging left and right sorted halves, you put constraints between all elements in left and the first element in right, or maybe to one of right elements.\n\nLooking at N=5:\n\n- Merge constraints between left and right groups:\n  - `(<= in0 in3)`\n  - `(<= in1 in3)`\n  - `(<= in2 in3)`\n\nSo the constraints for merging are from each element in left half to the first element of the right half.\n\nSimilarly for N=6:\n\n- Right half: in3, in4, in5\n- Merge constraints:\n\n  - `(<= in0 in3)`\n  - `(<= in1 in3)`\n  - `(<= in2 in3)`\n\nAlso, within right half, `(<= in3 in4)`, `(<= in3 in5)`, `(<= in4 in5)`\n\nSo this is extending the ordering constraints inside the right half as well.\n\n**Summary of recursion for constraints:**\n\n- If size==2: `(<= in_l in_r)`\n- Else:\n  - divide into left (l..mid) and right (mid+1..r)\n  - build constraints recursively for left, right\n  - add ordering constraints inside right (merging step), like `(<= in_mid in Mid+1), (<= in_mid in r)`, etc.\n  - add merge constraints: for each i in [l..mid], `(<= in_i in mid+1)`\n\nBut the right half ordering also is built recursively, so inside right half we will have all ordering constraints.\n\nWait, in the example for N=6:\n\n```\n(and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and  \n  ( <=  in0 in1)  \n  ( <=  in0 in2))  \n  ( <=  in1 in2))  \n  ( <=  in3 in4))  \n  ( <=  in3 in5))  \n  ( <=  in4 in5))  \n  ( <=  in0 in3))  \n  ( <=  in1 in3))  \n  ( <=  in2 in3))\n```\n\nThis means:\n\n- Left half (0-2): `(<= in0 in1)`, `(<= in0 in2)`, `(<= in1 in2)`\n- Right half (3-5): `(<= in3 in4)`, `(<= in3 in5)`, `(<= in4 in5)`\n- Merge: `(<= in0 in3)`, `(<= in1 in3)`, `(<= in2 in3)`\n\nNo constraints like `(<= in3 in5)` within right, but yes `(<= in3 in5)` appears.\n\nHence the recursion mixes building all pairs of constraints inside halves (like transitive ordering) - but the base examples show not always full pairwise ordering, but partial pairs.\n\nIn the left halves: all pairs (like `(<= in0 in2)`) and all pairs between pairs in the half.\n\nWithin right half: the same leave as recursive.\n\nThen merge constraints: from every element in left half to the first element in right half `(<= in_i in_j)` with j=mid+1.\n\nHence the recurrence:\n\n1. For a group, generate constraints forming a sorted ordering from the left to right side recursively.\n2. For each half recursively generate all internal ordering constraints.\n3. For merging:\n   - Add `(<= in_i in_mid+1)` for all i in left half (l..mid)\n   \nTo confirm, for N=5:\n\n- Left half: 0..2\n\n  - `(<= in0 in1)`, `(<= in0 in2)`, `(<= in1 in2)`\n\n- Right half: 3..4\n\n  - `(<= in3 in4)`\n\n- Merge constraints:\n\n  - `(<= in0 in3)`, `(<= in1 in3)`, `(<= in2 in3)`\n\nNo further constraints connecting other right elements for merge.\n\n**Implementation plan:**\n\nFor general N:\n\n- Define recursive function build_constraints(l, r):\n\n  - if (r - l +1) == 2:\n\n    - Return list: `(<= in_l in_r)`\n\n  - if size == 1:\n\n    - Return empty list\n\n  - Else:\n\n    - mid = (l + r) // 2\n\n    - left_constraints = build_constraints(l, mid)\n\n    - right_constraints = build_constraints(mid +1, r)\n\n    - merge_constraints:\n\n      - For i in l..mid:\n\n        - `(<= in_i in_{mid+1})`\n\n    - Return:\n\n      left_constraints + right_constraints + merge_constraints\n\nThis matches the given examples.\n\nAlso verify base cases:\n\n- At N=2:\n\n  - `(<= in0 in1)`  (l=0, r=1)\n\n- At N=3:\n\n  l=0, r=2, mid=1\n\n  left: 0..1 => `(<= in0 in1)`\n\n  right: 2..2 => no constraints\n\n  merge: `(<= in0 in2)`, `(<= in1 in2)`\n\nMatches example.\n\nFor N=4:\n\n l=0, r=3, mid=1\n\n left: 0..1 => `(<= in0 in1)`\n\n right: 2..3 => `(<= in2 in3)`\n\n merge: `(<= in0 in2)`, `(<= in1 in2)`\n\nExactly matches example.\n\nSimilarly for N=5:\n\n l=0, r=4, mid=2\n\n left: 0..2 => `(<= in0 in1)`, `(<= in0 in2)`, `(<= in1 in2)`\n\n right: 3..4 => `(<= in3 in4)`\n\n merge: `(<= in0 in3)`, `(<= in1 in3)`, `(<= in2 in3)`\n\nMatches example.\n\n**For N=13:**\n\nWe will just implement this recursion and enumerate all `(<= in_i in_j)` constraints. Then combine all constraints in nested `(and ...)` form.\n\n**Generating nested and:**\n\nThe given examples nest `(and ... )` such that there is one binary `and` combining two constraints with a third constraint, etc.\n\nSo the binary structure is just a deeply nested left-associative and.\n\nExample: For constraints c1, c2, c3, c4, c5\n\n```\n(and (and (and (and c1 c2) c3) c4) c5)\n```\n\nWe shall adopt same style.\n\nLet's write code or simulate manually:\n\nFirst, generate all constraints as a list of SMT-LIB strings:\n\n`(<= in_i in_j)` strings, where i<j\n\nThen nest with `(and ...)` left associatively.\n\nFinalize by `(assert (and ...))`\n\n**Now generate constraints for N=13:**\n\nCall build_constraints(0,12)\n\nLet\u2019s map the recursion:\n\n- build_constraints(0,12)\n  -

N-1 appended at the end.\n- Since the pattern nests all constraints inside (and ...), the exact example wraps it with many nested (and (and ...)), but we should simplify to just one top-level (assert (and ...)) as the prompt requires, no nested and.\n\nLet's generate the clauses:\n\nPairs constraints ( > in_i in_j ) for all 0 \u2264 j < i < 19.\n\nSpecifically:\n\ni = 1: ( > in1 in0 )\n\ni = 2: ( > in2 in0 ), ( > in2 in1 )\n\ni = 3: ( > in3 in0 ), ( > in3 in1 ), ( > in3 in2 )\n\n...\n\ni = 18: ( > in18 in0 ), ( > in18 in1 ), ..., ( > in18 in17 )\n\nThen after those, the constraints:\n\n( > in in0 ), ( > in in1 ), ..., ( > in in18 )\n\nNow, write all clauses in one and clause in SMT-LIB.\n\nVariable names are consistent as per examples: in0, in1, ..., in18, plus \"in\".\n\nThe output is therefore:\n\n(assert (and \n  ( > in1 in0 )\n  ( > in2 in0 )\n  ( > in2 in1 )\n  ...\n  ( > in18 in0 )\n  ( > in18 in1 )\n  ...\n  ( > in18 in17 )\n  ( > in in0 )\n  ( > in in1 )\n  ...\n  ( > in in18 )\n))\n\nI will write out all clauses with exact parentheses and spacing as in examples:\n\nEach clause looks like:\n\n( >  inX inY)\n\n( >  in inX)\n\nNote from examples: there are two spaces between '>' and inX, and one space before inY.

(and (<= in0 in24) (<= in1 in24) ... (<= in23 in24)) ... ) ... (<= in0 in1)))\n\nwith deeply nested and's for canonical format, but the question wants the exact canonical format like the above.\n\nTherefore, for N=25, the constraint will be a deeply nested and of and of and of ... all (<= in_i in_j) for all i<j.\n\nNumber of constraints:\n\nNumber of pairs = N*(N-1)/2 = 25*24/2 = 300.\n\nEach constraint is (<= in_i in_j).\n\nWe will produce a nested chain of 300 and's wrapping all these constraints.\n\nThe nested form is like:\n\n(assert (and (and (and ... (cond1) (cond2)) (cond3)) ... ))\n\nBut in examples, the nesting is left-associative and just a chain of and's.\n\nOur job is to build the longest nested form of and's where the last two operands are constraints, and the left is also an and (...).\n\nWe need to form a deeply nested and expression as in the examples.\n\nHence, we will build the list of constraints in order:\n\nFor j = 24 down to 1:\n\n  For i = 0 up to j-1:\n\n    append (<= in_i in_j)\n\nConstruct nested and from the last to first:\n\n Start from (<= in0 in1)\n\nThen (and (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2))\n\nThen (and (and (<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2)) (<= in0 in3)) ... etc.\n\nBut the examples suggest the order is:\n\nFirst all constraints with highest j=24, for i = 0..23:\n\n (<= in0 in24) (<= in1 in24) ... (<= in23 in24)\n\nThen constraints with j=23:\n\n (<= in0 in23) ... (<= in22 in23)\n\n...\n\nContinuing down to j=1:\n\n (<= in0 in1)\n\nWe then nest (and (... ) (cond)) from right to left:\n\nStart from last cond:\n\n (<= in0 in1)\n\nThen:\n\n (and (<= in1 in2) (<= in0 in1))\n\n which looks different from example.\n\nNo, the example shows nesting all constraints as:\n\n(and (and (and cond1 cond2) cond3) cond4) ... condN)\n\nBut in the above N=9 example, the ordering is from largest j downwards, each inner j contributes constraints with i<j.\n\nSo we should do:\n\nInitialize acc = (<= in0 in1)\n\nThen for j=2 to 24\n\n  For i=0 to j-1\n\n    acc = (and acc (<= in_i in_j))\n\nSo the nesting is left associative and the constraints are ordered from smallest j to largest j and i loop.\n\nBut in the N=9 example, seems the opposite:\n\nThe example starts with (<= in0 in8), (<= in1 in8), ... then (<= in0 in7), etc.\n\nPossibly the order of constraints in nesting is reversed or it doesn't matter, as long as they are all \"anded\".\n\nSo to mimic exactly the canonical format from above and be consistent, we do:\n\nStart with acc = (<= in0 in24)\n\nThen add all (<= in_i in_j) for i < j in decreasing order of j:\n\ni.e., for j = 24 down to 1:\n\n  for i = 0 to j-1:\n\n      add (<= in_i in_j) to acc as (and acc constraint)\n\nBut this would cause the first constraints to be at deepest nesting.\n\nThe example shows the deepest nesting is the last constraints. So correct approach is:\n\nBuild list of constraints in order:\n\nList constraints = []\n\nFor j = 24 down to 1:\n\n  For i = 0 to j-1:\n\n    constraints.append((<= in_i in_j))\n\nThen nest (and ... ) left associative:\n\nStart with last constraint as acc\n\nFor c in constraints[-2::-1]:\n\n  acc = (and c acc)\n\nAt the end: acc will have the form (and (and ... ) (<= in0 in1)) with the same nesting as examples.\n\nThen wrap with (assert acc)\n\nTherefore, produce full string in SMT-LIB format.\n\nUse spaces exactly as in examples, with spaces after all parentheses:\n\ne.g.,  (assert (and  ( <=  in0 in8)  ( <=  in1 in8)) ... )\n\nWe also observe that each '<=' constraint has spaces inside like: ( <=  in0 in8)\n\nand the whole and expression shows multiple spaces:\n\nLike:\n\n(assert (and (and  ... ) (<= ...)))\n\nObserve examples have no extra commentary.\n\nSo we will produce the exact nested chain accordingly.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and

(and constraint1 constraint2) constraint3) ...) constraintN)))\n\nConstraints ordered from first to last (probably from largest k to smallest or smallest k to largest, let's verify with previous examples).\n\nLooking at N=5 example:\n\nConstraints order:\n\n(<= in0 in4) (<= in1 in4) (<= in2 in4) (<= in3 in4)\n(<= in0 in3) (<= in1 in3) (<= in2 in3)\n(<= in0 in2) (<= in1 in2)\n(<= in0 in1)\n\nThey are grouped by k from k=4 down to 1, and within k, increasing i from 0 to k-1.\n\nSo the order follows k decreasing from N-1 to 1, then i increasing.\n\nWe'll follow same.\n\nSo let's generate constraints in order k=11 down to k=1, i=0 to k-1.\n\nWe'll build them as nested (and)s starting from leftmost constraint, wrapping the next.\n\nLet's programmatically write down first few constraints to confirm the nesting order.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1: (<= in0 in11)\n2: (<= in1 in11)\n...\n11: (<= in10 in11)\n12: (<= in0 in10)\n...\n21: (<= in9 in10)\n...\n...\n\nLast constraint (66): (<= in0 in1)\n\nWe'll nest as:\n\n(and constraint1 (and constraint2 (and ... (and constraint65 constraint66)...)))\n\nLet's output final SMT-LIB assertion accordingly.\n\nEach (<= in_i in_j) is formatted as (<= inX inY).\n\nLet's write all constraints explicitly and nest them.\n\nBecause 66 (and)s is very cumbersome, but as per example, they show all nested (and)s even for 12 constraints.\n\nGiven the instructions, we output all constraints with correct nesting.\n\nLet's generate the nested (and)s:\n\nStart with constraints list from first to last:\n\nConstraints =\n[(<= in0 in11), (<= in1 in11), ..., (<= in10 in11),\n (<= in0 in10), ..., (<= in9 in10),\n ...\n (<= in0 in1)]\n\nTotal 66 constraints.\n\nWe nest as:\n\n(and constraint1 (and constraint2 (and ... (and constraint65 constraint66)...)))\n\nFinally wrap in (assert (and ...)).\n\nAlternatively, according to the example, the outer most (assert (and ...)), inside is the nested (and)s without extra parentheses.\n\nWe'll follow the same format.\n\nHence the final SMT-LIB string is:\n\n(assert (and (and (and (and ... (and constraint1 constraint2) constraint3)... ) constraint66)))\n\nWe will generate and output this accordingly.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n(assert (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (and (<= in0 in11) (<= in1 in11)) (<= in2 in11)) (<= in3 in11)) (<= in4 in11)) (<= in5 in11)) (<= in6 in11)) (<= in7 in11)) (<= in8 in11)) (<= in9 in11)) (<= in10 in11)) (<= in0 in10)) (<= in1 in10)) (<= in2 in10)) (<= in3 in10)) (<= in4 in10)) (<= in5 in10)) (<= in6 in10)) (<= in7 in10)) (<= in8 in10)) (<= in9 in10)) (<= in0 in9)) (<= in1 in9)) (<= in2 in9)) (<= in3 in9)) (<= in4 in9)) (<= in5 in9)) (<= in6 in9)) (<= in7 in9)) (<= in8 in9)) (<= in0 in8)) (<= in1 in8)) (<= in2 in8)) (<= in3 in8)) (<= in4 in8)) (<= in5 in8)) (<= in6 in8)) (<= in7 in8)) (<= in0 in7)) (<= in1 in7)) (<= in2 in7)) (<= in3 in7)) (<= in4 in7)) (<= in5 in7)) (<= in6 in7)) (<= in0 in6)) (<= in1 in6)) (<= in2 in6)) (<= in3 in6)) (<= in4 in6)) (<= in5 in6)) (<= in0 in5)) (<= in1 in5)) (<= in2 in5)) (<= in3 in5)) (<= in4 in5)) (<= in0 in4)) (<= in1 in4)) (<= in2 in4)) (<= in3 in4)) (<= in0 in3)) (<= in1 in3)) (<= in2 in3)) (<= in0 in2)) (<= in1 in2)) (<= in0 in1))))\n</answer>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 325, "completion_tokens": 1940, "total_tokens": 2265, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_79b79be41f"}}, "error": null}

The constraints are expressed mostly as ordering constraints between the inputs (like `<= inX inY`).\n\nLet's analyze the last fully given example (N=21):\n\n- The variables seem divided into groups: \n  - in0..in5\n  - in6..in10\n  - in11..in15\n  - in16..in20\n- For each group of inputs, there are constraints enforcing small groups and then higher-level relations between groups.\n\nSimilarly, for N=16, there's a perfect 2-level binary grouping:\n\n- 0..3, 4..7, 8..11, 12..15\n- Constraining pairs inside the groups, then constraining group heads together, and then relating top-level groups.\n\nFor N=27, number 27 is not a power of two, but is 3*9 or almost 16 + 11.\n\nFrom the pattern, constraints seem divided according to balanced groupings, often binary splits.\n\nLet's try to recognize the pattern more explicitly:\n\nFor example at N=16:\n\nLevel 1 groups:\n- (in0 in1), (in2 in3), (in4 in5), (in6 in7), (in8 in9), (in10 in11), (in12 in13), (in14 in15)\n\nLevel 2 groups:\n- group0: in0..in3 (with constraints (<= in0 in2), (<= in1 in2), etc)\n- group1: in4..in7\n- group2: in8..in11\n- group3: in12..in15\n\nAnd then higher level:\n\n- constraining the heads of these groups (e.g. (<= in0 in8), etc)\n\nAt N=21, we see 4 groups of size 6 (mostly), and then constraints between groups.\n\nSo for N=27, a natural grouping is:\n\n3 groups of size 9 (since 27 = 3*9):\n\n- group 0: in0..in8\n- group 1: in9..in17\n- group 2: in18..in26\n\nThen inside each group of 9, we can recursively apply the pattern of smaller groups:\n\nAt 9, it is not directly given, but from the examples we can infer:\n\n- For N=10, we see groups of (in0..in4) and (in5..in9)\n  \nAt N=5, there is a small pattern of constraints:\n\n(N=5):\n(assert (and \n  (and (and (and (and (and  ( <=  in0 in1)  ( <=  in0 in2))  ( <=  in1 in2))  ( <=  in3 in4))  ( <=  in0 in3))  ( <=  in1 in3))  ( <=  in2 in3)))\n\nSo 5 inputs are grouped maybe into (in0, in1, in2) and (in3, in4), with constraints inside these groups and between groups.\n\nExtrapolating for 9:\n\n9 = 5 + 4, or better 4 + 5.\n\nSuppose for 9 inputs, we recursively apply grouping like (in0..in4) and (in5..in8), and impose constraints similar to smaller examples.\n\nHence for group size 9:\n\n- group 0: in0..in4\n- group 1: in5..in8\n\nThen for the entire 27 inputs:\n\n- group0: in0..in8 (which is structured further)\n- group1: in9..in17 (structured in same manner)\n- group2: in18..in26 (structured similarly)\n\nFinally, at the highest level, constraints between the groups:\n\n- constraints (<= in0 in9), (<= in1 in9), ... (<= in8 in9) between groups 0 and 1\n- constraints (<= in0 in18), ... (<= in8 in18) between groups 0 and 2\n- constraints (<= in9 in18), ... (<= in17 in18) between groups 1 and 2\n\nThis would follow the previous pattern of relating heads of subtrees and inputs of lower levels.\n\nRegarding actual format: The examples show deeply nested `(and ...)` expressions, roughly corresponding to the binary tree structure, e.g. (and (and A B) C) etc.\n\nSo our goal is to write the constraint as:\n\n(assert (and\n  (and ...\n    (<all constraints on group0>)\n  )\n  (and ...\n    (<all constraints on group1>)\n  )\n  (and ...\n    (<all constraints on group2>)\n  )\n  (<all constraints between groups>)\n))\n\nEach group of size 9 is composed similarly:\n\n9 split into groups of (0..4) and (5..8), each with constraints.\n\nSimilarly for 5, we've constraints:\n\n( <= in0 in1)\n( <= in0 in2)\n( <= in1 in2)\n( <= in3 in4)\n( <= in0 in3)\n( <= in1 in3)\n( <= in2 in3)\n\nApplying the same style constraint at 9 would be recursive, as:\n\n- For (0..4): the same constraints for N=5 on in0..in4 adjusted accordingly\n- For (5..8): similarly for N=4 (not given), but we can guess from the pattern for 4 inputs the constraints would be like:\n\nFor 4 inputs (guess by analogy with first half of N=16 where 4-element groups), constraints like:\n\n( <= inX inY) for pairs inside, then linking the pairs together.\n\nMoreover, at N=8 (from the N=16 example), groups of 4 constraints inside.\n\nThus we apply the pattern recursively.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of approach**\n\nDefine a recursive function `make_constraint(start, end)` that:\n\n- If group size is 1, no constraints.\n\n- If group size is 2, (assert (and ( <= inStart inEnd)))\n\n- For larger groups, split approximately in half, constrain pairs inside halves recursively, constrain pairs between halves.\n\n- Between certain pairs, also put constraints like (<= in[left_half_start] in[right_half_start]) and constraints relating inputs across halves.\n\n- Finally combine all with (and ...).\n\nApply this to N=27:\n\n- split into three groups of 9:\n\n- Apply recursively on each group of size 9.\n\n- Then constrain group heads across the three groups.\n\nWe must be very explicit about the actual constraints.\n\n---\n\n**Filling exact constraints for subgroups**\n\nGiven the style of constraints in the examples, we see at N=16:\n\n- Level 3: constraints inside pairs of inputs (like ( <= in0 in1) ( <= in2 in3))\n\n- Level 2: constraints between pairs (like ( <= in0 in2), ( <= in1 in2))\n\n- Level 1: constraints between groups of 4 (like ( <= in0 in4), etc)\n\n- Level 0: constraints between groups of 8 (like ( <= in0 in8), etc)\n\nSo at each level grouping:\n\n- constrain pairs inside the group (lowest level)\n\n- constrain these pairs via partial ordering to form a larger chain\n\nThere is also constraints like (<= a b) on certain subsets most likely as per the ordering in a binary tree.\n\n---\n\nLet's define helper function that given start and end indices, will:\n\n- If size == 1: return []\n\n- If size == 2: return [ (<= inStart inEnd) ]\n\n- If size > 2:\n\n  - Split group into two parts. We choose split at mid = start + (end - start) // 2\n\n  - Recurse on left and right groups to get constraints\n\n  - Add constraints linking pairs: in left and right subsequences\n\nFor the \"pairs inside leaf groups\" constraints:\n\n- For the lowest level in N=16 example, constraints like ( <= in0 in1), ( <= in2 in3), etc\n\nThen between these pairs, constraints like ( <= in0 in2), ( <= in1 in2), etc to \"merge\" pairs\n\nThis can be interpreted as for each pair of pairs (two pairs at leaves), constraining combined relationships of ordering.\n\nAt the merging step between groups:\n\n- The \"head\" of left group is <= the head of right group\n\n- The others in left group also <= head of right group to maintain monotonicity\n\nSimilarly from N=16 example: For the group (0..3):\n\n- ( <= in0 in1), ( <= in2 in3)\n\n- ( <= in0 in2), ( <= in1 in2)\n\n- Then for the group (0..7):\n\n- linking (0..3) and (4..7)\n\n- constraints ( <= in0 in4), ( <= in1 in4), ( <= in2 in4), ( <= in3 in4)\n\nThus the \"head\" of right group is the lowest index in the right half\n\n---\n\n**Construct coding approach:**\n\nDefine a recursive way:\n\nFor group with indices [start..end]:\n\n1) If size == 1: no constraints\n\n2) If size == 2: constraint (<= inStart inEnd)\n\n3) Else:\n\n- mid = start + (end - start) // 2\n\n- left constraints = recurse(start, mid)\n\n- right constraints = recurse(mid+1, end)\n\n- lowest left = start\n\n- lowest right = mid+1\n\n- pairwise constraints to merge pairs inside left group:\n\n  * For all pairs of adjacent leaf pairs inside left group, constraints as in the examples: (<= inX inY), etc\n\n- similarly for right group\n\n- constraints relating left group to right group:\n\n  * For each i in [start..mid], (<= in_i in_mid+1)\n\nReturn (and (and left_constraints right_constraints) and list of merging constraints)\n\n---\n\nNow, since this is complicated, and formatting the final output requires a nested `and` structure as exemplified.\n\nFrom the example N=5 for 5 inputs (0..4):\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n( <= in0 in1)\n\n( <= in0 in2)\n\n( <= in1 in2)\n\n( <= in3 in4)\n\n( <= in0 in3)\n\n( <= in1 in3)\n\n( <= in2 in3)\n\nThe structure is:\n\n(and\n\n  (and (and (and (and (and\n\n    (<= in0 in1)\n\n    (<= in0 in2)\n\n  ) (<= in1 in2))\n\n  (<= in3 in4))\n\n  (<= in0 in3))\n\n  (<= in1 in3))\n\n  (<= in2 in3)\n\n)\n\nWe can identify that this corresponds to:\n\n- a left group [0..2]\n\n- a right group [3..4]\n\n- couple of constraints connecting left group to right group\n\n---\n\nFor N=9 similarly,\n\ngrouping [0..4] and [5..8] recursively in the same way would work.\n\nThen finally for top-level N=27:\n\ngrouping [0..8], [9..17], [18..26]\n\nBut in examples we saw only binary splits, no ternary splits.\n\nSo we better split [0..26] into [0..13] and [14..26], i.e. roughly half.\n\nBecause 27 is not a power of two, split into two large groups:\n\n- Group 1: indices [0..13]: size 14\n\n- Group 2: indices [14..26]: size 13\n\nThen recursively process these groups.\n\nSimilarly process [0..13]:\n\n- split into [0..6] (7) and [7..13] (7)\n\nGroup [0..6]:\n\n- split into [0..3] and [4..6]\n\n[0..3] size 4: we can apply constraints like N=4\n\n[4..6] size 3: split into [4..5] and [6..6]\n\n[4..5] size 2: (<= in4 in5)\n\n[6..6]: single element no constraints\n\nThen constraints connecting in4..in5 to in6\n\nSimilarly for [7..13]:\n\n- size 7, split into [7..9] and [10..13]\n\nAnd so on recursively.\n\nThe general rule would be binary splits, recursively.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTo provide the exact SMT-LIB string for N=27 according to this pattern, we must:\n\n- reproduce nested (and (and ...)) structure corresponding to recursive binary splits\n\n- each leaf of size 2 creates a constraint (<= inX inY)\n\n- produce constraints to \"merge\" these groups per examples\n\nI will build the constraint step by step below:\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: define helper function to generate nested and clauses**\n\nUsing indentation for readability (the final output must have nested `(and ... )` but in one line).\n\nWe will

Then a series of (not (= ... t)) constraints that combine sums of inputs:\n\nThese constraints come in two groups:\n- For each i in [0 ..

We will reproduce the nested pattern as well.\n\nOrdering the constraints:\n\nFirst all the bound constraints for in0 to in17 and t (20 variables total: 18 inputs + t).\n\nThen the \"not\" constraints:\n\nFirst group: k=0 => i=0..17 \nSecond group: k=1 => i=1..17\n...\nlast group: k=17 => i=17..17 (only in17)\n\nNumber of constraints:\n\nBounds: 18 inputs * 2 = 36 + 2 for t = 38 constraints.\n\nNumber of not constraints:\n\nSum over k=0 to 17 of (18 - k) = total = 18 + 17 + ... +1 = (18*19)/2 = 171 constraints.\n\nTotal constraints = 38 + 171 = 209 constraints.\n\nRepresenting nested (and (and ...)) wrapping:\n\nGiven examples, they have nested (and ... (and ...)) pattern associating constraints one by one inside nested ands.\n\nWe will follow the example style: starting with (assert (and ...)), inside which nested (and ...) wrapping pairs of constraints repeatedly until all are included.\n\nWe don't need extra commentary but follow the exact format carefully.\n\nFor nested sums, need to write expressions like:\n\nFor sum in0..3:\n(+ in3 (+ in2 (+ in1 in0)))\n\nSmaller sums:\n\nSum in0..0: in0\n\nSum in0..1: (+ in1 in0)\n\nSum in0..2: (+ in2 (+ in1 in0))\n\nSum in0..3: (+ in3 (+ in2 (+ in1 in0)))\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe can write a function to build these sums.\n\nSimilarly for sums in_k..i for all k <= i.\n\n---\n\nLet me build the SMT-LIB string now for N=18.\n\nVariable names: in0 ... in17\n\nt variable same as in examples.\n\nBounds (>= and <=) for in0..in17 and t.\n\nBuild all not equal constraints.\n\nThen wrap with (assert (and ... )) nested appropriately.\n\n---\n\nDue to the size, I'll generate the final

Generate all 171 constraints (<= in_i in_j), i<j.\n2. Combine them into a balanced binary tree of (and ...), i.e. repeatedly combine pairs of constraints or (and ...)'s in pairs.\n3. Finally wrap everything in a top-level (assert (and ...)).\n\nMoreover, the constraints are arranged in order starting with comparisons involving the highest index first:\n\n- (<= in0 in18), (<= in1 in18), ..., (<= in17 in18)\n- then comparisons with 17: (<= in0 in17), (<= in1 in17), ..., (<= in16 in17)\n- continue decreasing second parameter down to 1:\n- finally (<= in0 in1)\n\nSo the order of

C_0, C_1, ..., C_170, then:\n\nand0 = (and C_0 C_1)\nand1 = (and and0 C_2)\nand2 = (and and1 C_3)\n...\n\nNo, but in the examples, they do nested pairwise (and), combining two constraints or two (and ...) expressions at a time, building a balanced tree.\n\nWe will simulate that here:\n\nTake all constraints in the above order as leaves.\n\nWhile more than one element remains:\n  Combine elements in pairs by (and e1 e2)\n  If odd elements remain, the last one is passed up as is.\nRepeat until only one element remains.\n\nFinally wrap in (assert ...).\n\nWe must produce canonical SMTLIB format

Variables:\n   - Inputs: in0, in1, ..., in{N-1}\n   - t\n\n2. Bounds on in_i:\n   ( >=  in_i -10)\n   ( <=  in_i 10)\n\n3. Bounds on t:\n   ( >=  t -100)\n   ( <=  t 100)\n\n4. Non-equality constraints:\n   These are \"not (= sum t)\" constraints, where sum is partial sums of input variables.\n\n5. The sums come in three types:\n   - sum of single input i: (not (= in_i t))\n   - sum of pairs: for i < j: (not (= (+ in_j in_i) t))\n   - sums of longer sequences:\n\n     For example at N=4:\n\n     - (not (= ( +  in1 in0) t))\n     - (not (= ( +  in2 ( +  in1 in0)) t))  => sum of in0+in1+in2\n     - (not (= ( +  in3 ( +  in2 ( +  in1 in0))) t)) => sum of in0+in1+in2+in3\n     - and others.\n\nLooking carefully at the N=4 case:\n\nAt N=4, the sums constrained by \"(not (= ... t))\" are:\n- in0\n- in1\n- in2\n- in3\n- in1 + in0\n- in2 + in1\n- in3 + in2\n- in2 + (in1 + in0) = in0 + in1 + in2\n- in3 + (in2 + in1) = in1 + in2 + in3\n- in3 + (in2 + (in1 + in0)) = in0 + in1 + in2 + in3\n\nThere are constraints indexed by single inputs, sums of adjacent pairs, sums of triplets, sums of quadruplets, all continuous sequences of inputs.\n\nHence, the \"not equals t\" constraints correspond to **all non-empty continuous subsequences** of the input variables from length 1 up to N.\n\nAlso, the order of sums in SMT-LIB is right-associative nested pluses. For example:\n\nsum_{0,1,2} = (+ in2 (+ in1 in0))\nsum_{1,2,3} = (+ in3 (+ in2 in1))\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe single sums appear twice in the N=4 example, but the pairs and longer sums are always contiguous.\n\nSo for N=13:\n\n- Bounds on all in_i for i in [0..12]\n- Bounds on t\n- For all continuous subarrays in[i..j], where 0 <= i <= j <= 12, generate \"(not (= sum t))\" where sum is the nested plus of that subarray.\n\nThis is the final structure.\n\nImplementation plan:\n\n- Create bounds on each in_i.\n- Create bounds on t.\n- Create for all i in [0..12], (not (= in_i t))\n- For all length from 2 to 13:\n    - for i in [0..N-length]:\n        - j = i + length -1\n        - sum = nested plus of inputs from i to j\n        - create (not (= sum t))\n\nAdditionally, note for verifying from examples: For N=2, the constraints of the form:\n\n(not (= in0 t))\n(not (= in1 t))\n(not (= (+ in1 in0) t))\n\nWhich confirms.\n\nFor canonical format, all constraints must be in one top-level (assert (and ...)) clause.\n\nOrder:\n\n- first all bounds on in_i's, in order from in0 to in12\n- then bounds on t\n- then (not (= ...)) constraints for all continuous input subsequences in order:\n  - first all length=1 (in0 to in12)\n  - then length=2 from i=0,...,11\n  - length=3 etc.\n\nNote: sum in SMT-LIB syntax is right-associative nested additions.\n\nExample for sum in0+in1+in2:\n(+ in2 (+ in1 in0))\n\nFor sum in9+in10+in11+in12 (length=4, i=9):\n(+ in12 (+ in11 (+ in10 in9)))\n\nThe final expression is large but follows the pattern.\n\nNo extra commentary inside the output, only the exact constraint string.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>(assert (and \n  (>= in0 -10) (<= in0 10) \n  (>= in1 -10) (<= in1 10) \n  (>= in2 -10) (<= in2 10) \n  (>= in3 -10) (<= in3 10) \n
